## Explore First, Read Later

We strongly recommend, if you have not already, to explore the claim tester and other creation options in-site. Many of your questions should be answered by the interface and is much easier to understand than a bunch of long text here in this documentation. Just go explore and experiment first.

Most of your setup and management (and oftentimes all) will be done directly in-site via the developer portal or Create tab. Get started at [https://bitbadges.io/create](https://bitbadges.io/create).

## Tokens vs Badges

We use the terms tokens and badges interchangeably. For example, "badgeIds" refers to token IDs. In the past, our niche was primarily earned badges, and we are slowly trying to rollout rebrands to full tokens. However, the core interface is still named "badges" behind the scenes.

## Gate Any Service In 2 Steps

Any service can be gated by ANY criteria simply in just 2 steps.

1. **Authenticate** - We recommend Sign In with BitBadges but it could be any approach
2. **Verify Claim Success** - Check the user satisfies a BitBadges claim (via post-success hooks, API, many ways!)

Claims are the universal connectors. Claim criteria can be anything from a payment to token ownership to Discord servers. Implement it any way you want (including custom logic) at [https://bitbadges.io/create](https://bitbadges.io/create)!
