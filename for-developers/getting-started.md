# ðŸš´â™‚ Getting Started

**Follow These Steps**

1. Gain familiarity with the [BitBadges API](broken-reference) and [SDK](broken-reference).
2. Do you need additional data not offered by the BitBadges API? Run your own [indexer](../indexer-api/indexer.md) and customize the data you store! If not, simply use the [BitBadges API](broken-reference) for fetching data.
3. Building a frontend? Use the [BitBadges website](broken-reference) code as a starting point and/or reference.&#x20;
4. To implement any additional functionality, use the [SDK](broken-reference)!&#x20;
5. Don't forget to check the [tutorials ](tutorials.md)to see if someone else has already done what you are trying to do!
