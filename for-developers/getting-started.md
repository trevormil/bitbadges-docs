# ðŸš´â™‚ Getting Started

**Perform Any Action with These Steps**

1. Gain familiarity with the [BitBadges API](broken-reference) and [SDK](broken-reference).
2. Do you need additional data or functionality not offered by the BitBadges API? Run your own [indexer](../indexer-api/indexer.md) and customize the data you store! If not, use the [BitBadges API](broken-reference) for your backend.
3. Building a frontend? Use the [BitBadges website](broken-reference) code as a starting point and/or reference. To implement new functionality, use the [SDK](broken-reference)!

**Have questions or feedback?**

Feel free to ask the BitBadges team or other developers in the BitBadges Discord.
