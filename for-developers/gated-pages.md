# Gated Pages

### What is Gated Content / Pages?

Gated content, also known as gated pages, refers to digital content that is restricted and only accessible to users who meet specific criteria or take certain actions. This content is "gated" behind a virtual barrier, which users must pass through to view or interact with the material.

On the BitBadges site, we offer a gated content (Gated Pages) feature to allow you to host Markdown content gated by criteria (reusing the BitBadges claims interface).

Note this is an easy to use place for you to host static information that is gated. If you need more dynamic functionality, consider implementing your own site with Sign In with BitBadges.

### Getting Started

Go to the Developer Portal -> Gated Pages on the BitBadges site. See the claims documentation if you want to customize the claim criteria process further.

IMPORTANT: Claims have to be non-indexed for gated content.

### Common Gating Methods

* **Badge Ownership**: Require users to own specific badges to access the content.
* **List Ownership:** Require users to be or not be on a list.
* **On-Chain Checks:** Require certain on-chain details about a user to be met.
