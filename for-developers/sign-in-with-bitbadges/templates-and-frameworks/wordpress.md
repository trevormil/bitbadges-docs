\== Description ==

This plugin allows users to gate their site with BitBadges - claims, payments, NFT badges, and more!

**Important Note:** This plugin ONLY handles authentication with BitBadges - it does not restrict access to your site by itself. For restricting access, we recommend using this plugin in conjunction with:

* [Force Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-login/) - Forces users to log in to view your site
* [Restrict Content](https://wordpress.org/plugins/restrict-content/) - Restrict content to logged-in users
* [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) - Advanced user roles and permissions
* Or other plugins that restrict access to your site
