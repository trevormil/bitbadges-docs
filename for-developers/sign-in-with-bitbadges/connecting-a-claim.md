# Connecting a Claim

Sign In with BitBadges becomes super powerful when you connect a BitBadges claim because you can natively check any criteria and authenticate in one flow:

* Check badge ownership
* Check social sign-ins from any supported social
* Receive privately held attestations securely
* Connect to 7000+ app integration plugins
* And much more all within the same flow.

Treat claims as not a part of the core SIWBB process. Do it all in one flow but verify it separately. 1) Authenticate the user 2) Verify the authenticated address meets claim criteria.

The claim verification is typically during the exchange flow handling.

1. Exchange and verify SIWBB request
2. Post-authentication, verify claim
