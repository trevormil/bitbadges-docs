# Build a dApp

Have an idea for a dApp? Let's walk through what you may need.

Also, don't forget to check the [tutorials ](../tutorials.md)to see if someone else has already done what you are trying to do!

**Do you need additional data or functionality not offered by the BitBadges API?**

Run your own [indexer](../../indexer-api/indexer.md) and customize the data you store! If not, simply use the [BitBadges API](broken-reference) for your backend.

**Do users need to interact with the blockchain and submit transactions?** **Or, do you just need to query the blockchain data?**

If so, use the [BitBadges SDK](broken-reference) to generate and broadcast transactions.&#x20;

If not, the BitBadges API / Indexer should be all you need, but you may find some useful functions within the SDK.

**Do you need additional functionality not offered natively by the** [**BitBadges Msgs**](../need-to-know/msgs.md)?&#x20;

Build your own smart contract with CosmWASM. See [Create a Smart Contract](create-a-smart-contract.md).&#x20;

**Do you need a custom frontend?**

Use the [BitBadges website](broken-reference) code as a starting point and/or reference.



**Have questions or feedback?**

Feel free to ask the BitBadges team or other developers in the BitBadges Discord.
