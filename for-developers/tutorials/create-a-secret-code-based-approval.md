# Create a Secret Code Based Approval

Approvals with secret codes can be implemented in the form of a Merkle challenge where the leaves / paths are kept secret from the public and handed out to specific users. You can also implement it as a centralized password-based solution where a centralized entity hands out specific codes if the correct password is entered.
