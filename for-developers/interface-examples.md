# 👨🏫 Interface Examples

For more examples about how the interface works, check the resources below. Feel free to reach out if any questions.

Resources:

* You can see transactions directly by querying the blockchain. Via the BitBadges site:
  * Visit the Update History tab for seeing all MsgUpdateCollection transactions.&#x20;
  * For MsgTransferBadges, go to the transfer activity -> see transaction. Note it must be an on-chain balances collection.
  * For approvals, go to a user's approvals on the Approvals tab -> Update History tab.
* You can also play around with the JSON feature on the Mint timeline form on the BitBadges site. Select an option -> JSON -> see what it looks like behind the scenes -> repeat. (Coming soon)
* Visit [here](https://github.com/BitBadges/bitbadges-indexer/tree/master/src/setup/bootstrapped-collections) for a list of Msgs that are used for bootstrapping a development chain in our indexer.
