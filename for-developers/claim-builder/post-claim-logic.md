# Post-Claim Logic

You may consider completing some additional action upon the user claiming successfully.

**In-Site**

If you need real-time webhooks, you can poll the GET claims endpoint and check the difference in users who have claimed between calls.&#x20;

**Zapier**

Consider using the Webhooks by Zapier plugin as an additional action.

**BitBadges APi**

If you already are auto-claiming with the BitBadges API, you already know when users claim, so you can just implement whatever you need right there.
