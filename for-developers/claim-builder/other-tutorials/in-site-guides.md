# In-Site Guides

The best way to get started with a tutorial is to use the Claim Tester in-site, and simply browse the guides section or experiment by adding plugins. The guides section will have a ton of common patterns and show you how to implement ideas that may or may not be supported natively. Find a similar use case to yours and apply the same steps. Even if there is nothing similar, most of the same principes to apply to almost all integrations.

If you need to see the resulting claim JSON (for advanced implementations), you can also see this in-site under the JSON tab of the claim details.
