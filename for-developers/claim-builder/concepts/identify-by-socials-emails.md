# Identify By Socials / Emails?

Do you identify your users by emails or a supported social username?

Select one of the webhook plugins (or forms for serverless) when setting up your claim. This will set you up to be able to track and maintain a map of (attempt ID / address) -> user socials or emails, enabling you to continue identifying your users how you already do!

Note: Verifying claim attempts are two-fold: 1) authenticate the user and 2) verify the claim. In this instance, step 1 would be authenticating the user email / social on your end if needed.&#x20;
