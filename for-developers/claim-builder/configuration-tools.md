# Configuration Tools

Configuration tools help automate the plugin configuration process for the creator. Instead of creating a tutorial for the creator to follow, you can create a configuration tool that automatically passes back all input configurations for the plugin automatically.

Tools will be permissionless such that the user can enter any tool URL and get configuration parameters; however, a specific plugin can define a featured tool to be highlighted.

**Examples**

* Create a tool that automatically fetches emails from a recent Google Calendar event and populates the Emails plugin correctly.

**Testing It**

Tools are permissionless, so you can simply enter it on the claim creation page and check if it works!

**Featuring It**

Create a pull request to this repository with your tool and its information. If you want us to feature it directly in-site, let us know!
