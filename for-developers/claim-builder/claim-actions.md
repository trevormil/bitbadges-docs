# Utility Flows

Checking criteria is pointless without a reward or utility offered to those who successfully "claim". The utility or rewards is left super open ended for you to custom implement the utility for your app.&#x20;

In some cases, the end utility may be directly on the BitBadges site:

* Badge / List Distribution: Gate badge distribution or address lists to those who claim.
* Points / Tiers: Gate points or tiers to claimees
* URLs / Content: In the rewards section, you may also find that some URLs / content can also be gated in-site.

In other cases, the end utility can be more custom implemented by you or the service provider.

* Gated access to a website, in-person event, or something else
* Literally anything you can think of!
