# Dynamic Store Zaps

We refer you [here](../dynamic-stores/adding-data.md) for more information.&#x20;

Zaps to add users to a dynamic store may be the most common use case for the BitBadges Zapier integration, notably because they can operate without crypto addresses in favor of emails. You can simply just use the Zap to parse email or user ID or username -> add to the store and let BitBadges handle the rest of the crypto-native stuff.
