# Overview

Plugins / webhooks are simply HTTP requests.

1. Configure your plugin / webhook in the BitBadges site
2. Set up your handler at the specified URL / method. Use the payload to implement your logic. The payload includes context about the attempt plus can include the user address, email, social usernames, custom inputs, and more.
   1. Check the pluginSecret to verify BitBadges as the origin of the request if this is important
3. Return the expected response that was configured (e.g. 200 OK)

```typescript
const handlePlugin = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  //Step 1: Handle the request payload from the plugin
  const body = req.body; //For POST
  const { _isSimulation, claimId, pluginSecret, bitbadgesAddress, ethAddress, solAddress, btcAddress, lastUpdated, createdAt } = body;
  const { ...otherCustomProvidedInputs } = body;
  
  //Step 1.5: Catch simulations if applicable. Don't run success logic on a dry run
  // if (_isSimulation) return doDryRunStuffOnly();
  
  //Step 2: Verify BitBadges as origin by checking plugin secret is correct
  const YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET = '';
  if (pluginSecret !== YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid plugin secret' });
  }
  
  //Step 3: Implement your custom logic here. Consider checking the plugin's creation / last updated time to implement version control.
  
  //Step 4: Return expected responses
  return res.status(200).json({});
};

export default handlePlugin;
```

We have designed plugins in a way to allow you maximum customization by letting you handle as much of the plugin logic as possible. This is a design decision as we believe the core logic of the distribution process should be decentralized and community-driven (not centralized on BitBadges servers).

**Potential Parties**

* Claim Creator - Entity creating the claim that uses the plugin
* Claiming User - End user attempting to claim
* Plugin Creator - Entity creating the plugin

**Timing of Requests**

Plugins can either be:

* Success hooks: Only sent after the claim succeeds. Typically for post-claim logic or rewards
* Processing hooks: Sent during execution and can affect the overall outcome of the claim depending on the response.

We also allow users to simulate (dry run) their claim attempts. Plugins are expected to handle these as necessary. These are all configurable in the creation process in-site.

**Parts of the Plugin**

* Backend Handler (Your API) - All plugins have a backend handler that we expect a 200 OK response from, along with other details depending on the configuration, at claim time.
* Claim Creator Input Handlers (Public / Private Parameters) - The creator will need to configure public and private parameter, if applicable. This can be done in-site or outsourced to a configuration tool.
* User Input Handlers (Custom Input Body) - The user may also need to enter inputs for the claim attempt. This can also be done in-site or outsourced to your own custom frontend.

**State Management**

If there is any core state required to be used, this must be managed on BitBadges side to avoid race conditions. To workaround this, the plugin will pass along expected updates IF the claim is passed (e.g. mark this one time use claim token as USED IF the claim is successful).

The golden rule here is that a successful response from your plugin DOES NOT mean the overall claim attempt was successful. Other plugins might fail. The other way around is also true. If your plugin fails, the overall claim may still be successful (e.g. 1 out of 10 plugins must pass but yours fails).

**Published Plugins**

Plugins are private and only usable by the creator and approved users by default, but you can publish them as well. Published plugins will be displayable in the directory (after a review process) and selectable by anyone creating a claim.

**Plugin IDs vs Instance IDs**

Plugin IDs are constant and specific to a specific plugin type. For example, the password pluginId is "password".

Instance IDs are a unique identifier for a specific plugin in your claim. This is to handle duplicates. For example, you may have two password plugins, one with instance Id "abc" and one with "def". This is just used as a unique identifier and can really be anything. If you only have one instance of a specific type, you can name it the same as the pluginId as well.
