# Getting Started

To create, publish, and maintain your plugin, go to [https://bitbadges.io/developer](https://bitbadges.io/developer) and use the Plugins tab. This should walk you through the whole process of configuration and submitting it to be used on the BitBadges site. If you are confused at any point, refer back to this documentation.

For testing purposes, you can setup using Pipedream's request bin ([https://pipedream.com/requestbin](https://pipedream.com/requestbin)) and just monitor incoming requests that way.
