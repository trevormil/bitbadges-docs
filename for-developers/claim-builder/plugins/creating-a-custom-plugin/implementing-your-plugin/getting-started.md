# Getting Started

To create, publish, and maintain your plugin, go to [https://bitbadges.io/developer](https://bitbadges.io/developer) and use the Plugins tab. This should walk you through the whole process of configuration and submitting it to be used on the BitBadges site. If you are confused at any point, refer back to this documentation.

You will have to enter a handler URI (can be changed later). You can setup a simple HTTP API handler beforehand, or for testing purposes, you can setup using Pipedream's request bin ([https://pipedream.com/requestbin](https://pipedream.com/requestbin)) and just monitor incoming requests that way.

**Published vs Private**

By default, you will always be able to create claims with your plugins that you have created.&#x20;

Your plugin may be published to the directory for others to use (with no restrictions). This requires a quick review process. If you choose to keep it private, you may also approve specific addresses or use an invite code approach to allow selected users to use the plugin.
