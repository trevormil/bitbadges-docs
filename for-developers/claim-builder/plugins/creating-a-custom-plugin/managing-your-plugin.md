# Managing Your Plugin

### Updating Your Plugin

After publishing and completing the review process, we leave updates and version control management up to you. It is your responsibility to keep claims compatible and functioning. Updating can be done at https://bitbadges.io/developer for the stuff stored on our end. On your end, you have control over what you&#x20;

If you need to implement a breaking change, consider using the createdAt, lastUpdated, or version fields passed via the context to implement version control and handle it on your end.

### Publishing Your Plugin

To publish your plugin, tick the publish box in the management form. This initiates the review process, and BitBadges will review it. Do not hesitate to reach out to us.

### Deleting Your Plugin

You can delete your plugin via https://bitbadges.io/developer. Note that this is a soft delete. It removes it from the directory, but all details will still be stored to allow existing claims to still be attempted.
