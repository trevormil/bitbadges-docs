# Do You Need a Custom Plugin?

### Do you actually need a custom plugin?

Before going through the entire plugin creation process, consider whether you actually need a plugin for your use case. Get creative!

For example,

* Use the Custom Validate plugin as a more streamlined alternative.
* Use the Codes plugin and give out claim codes from your side to those who meet the criteria
* Give out a secret password to those who satisfy a criteria
* See if Zapier can satisfy what you need
* Redirect users to the claim page w/ information like claim codes auto-filled out rather than needing a full custom plugin integration.
* Many apps / services use emails to identify users. If you have a list of emails, consider copy / pasting them into the Email plugin rather than needing to implement everything. Or in a similar fashion, if you have the users' crypto addresses, you can use the Address Restrictions plugin.
* And so on.

If you can implement everything you need while using existing plugins, consider creating  a configuration tool rather than a plugin.

[configuration-tools.md](../configuration-tools.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Or, consider creating a Zapier integration instead of a BitBadges custom plugin. Zapier's functionality is more complete than what BitBadges offers, especially for authenticated routes.
