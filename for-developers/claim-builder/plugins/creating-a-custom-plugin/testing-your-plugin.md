# Testing Your Plugin

The easiest way to test your plugin is with an address list claim. After your plugin has been created (does not have to be published):

**Step 1:** Create a private address list which has a claim configured with your plugin.

**Step 2:** Experiment with the claim and ensure your plugin is working correctly. Attempt to claim, try with different accounts, etc. Test it thoroughly.

**Step 3:** Delete the address list.



You may also consider creating it first on testnet mode, but note that everything will have to be reconfigured.
