# Testing Your Plugin

The easiest way to test your plugin is with the Test Claims tab in the developer portal.

After your plugin has been created (does not have to be published):

**Step 1:** Create a test claim which is configured with your plugin. The claim is not linked with any collection, list, etc, and will be deleted after you are done.

**Step 2:** Experiment with the claim and ensure your plugin is working correctly. Attempt to claim, try with different accounts, etc. Test it thoroughly. Try your configuration tools, user inputs, and more!
