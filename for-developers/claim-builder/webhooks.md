# Webhooks

You may consider completing some additional action AFTER the claim has been completed. A common flow for this is via webhooks.&#x20;

**In-Site**

You can poll the GET claims endpoint and checking the difference in users who have claimed between calls.&#x20;

**Zapier**

Consider using the Webhooks by Zapier tool ont heir site.

**BitBadges APi**

If you already are auto-claiming with the BitBadges API, you already know when users claim, so webhooks ar not applicable.
