# Build Custom Plugins

Pipedream Connect allows you to actually obtain the access tokens for your users and directly execute API requests on their behalf all programmatically. This takes all of the authentication setup out for you. This is great for seamlessly building third-party custom plugins. Simply setup Pipedream Connect in your app, and then, you have SDK access to 1000s of API integrations at your fingertips.

We refer you to their docs for setting this up.

**Connect to Your Custom Plugin Handler**

You will need your users to authorize you in order to be able to use their authentication.
