# Configuring Plugins

A claim is made up of one or more plugins. There are tons natively offered in-site, and you can also custom implement / add your own logic via custom plugins.&#x20;

Note: Certain plugins may become unavailable due to design decisions. For example, claim codes make no sense for on-demand claims since there is no "complete claim" action.

**Get Creative**

While we do offer a ton of functionality directly in-site, your desired functionality may not be directly supported. Before considering custom implementations, get creative!&#x20;

* Use claim codes or a password which can be used for anything
* Can your users be identified by email? Addresses? Use those plugins or dynamic stores
* Does Zapier support your approach? They have 7000+ apps and integrations natively. Pipedream?

**Multiple Ways of Implementing**

Even for something that is already implemented in-site, there are often multiple ways of doing so.  Evaluate the pros and cons of each approach. Select the best one for your use case.

Check out the Guides tab for these multi-method plugins. For example, Eventbrite has at least 6 ways of being implemented to fit your needs.
