# ðŸ‘¤ Accounts

This page will give you an overview of BitBadges accounts. It should be enough information for most, but for more low-level interaction, [the next page](accounts-technical.md) will give you more in-depth explanations.&#x20;

#### **How is BitBadges able to support addresses from different blockchains?**

To enable interoperability between different blockchains, each individual L1 blockchain will have its native addresses mapped to an equivalent Cosmos bech32 address and an account ID number. An account ID number will be assigned to the address when it interacts with the BitBadges blockchain or is sent $BADGE for the first time.&#x20;

As an example, the Ethereum null address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 maps to the BitBadges address bb1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqs7gvmv and will be assigned an account ID number upon interaction with the BitBadges blockchain. It would also map to an equivalent Bitcoin address as well.

Ethereum Example:

* Address (Bech32): `bb14au322k9munkmx5wrchz9q30juf5wjgz2cfqku`
* Address (Native - [EIP55](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55) Ethereum Hex): `0xAF79152AC5dF276D9A8e1E2E22822f9713474902`

Solana Example:

* Address (Native - Base58): 6H2af68Yyg6j7N4XeQKmkZFocYQgv6yYoU3Xk491efa5
* Address (Bech32): bb18el5ug46umcws58m445ql5scgg2n3tzagfecvl

Bitcoin Example&#x20;

* Address (Native - P2WPKH): bc1q9s7rynm5pwhluhecsmlku8rn5yej5wdgj0gv3e
* Address (Bech32): bb19s7rynm5pwhluhecsmlku8rn5yej5wdg8g75f9

#### Why can I convert Solana address to a  BitBadges / Eth / BTC address but not the other way around?

You may notice that you cannot go from a BitBadges / Eth address directly to a Solana address but you can the other way around. This is because conversion from a Solana address requires a hash, so if you just have the postimage of the hash (an Eth / BitBadges address), you cannot deduce the preimage without prior knowledge of it.

#### **Which address should I use (native or mapped one)? How to convert?**

For user experience, you should always display the user's native address on a frontend. However, the BitBadges blockchain **only** uses the mapped BitBadges addresses behind the scenes, never a native address. This can be converted behind the scenes using the converter functions from [BitBadges SDK](../bitbadges-sdk/) (address-converter). This can be done with any validly formatted address.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>import { ethToBitBadges, bitbadgesToEth, convertToBitBadgesAddress } from 'bitbadgesjs-sdk';
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>const bitbadgesAddress1 = convertToBitBadgesAddress(address);
</strong><strong>const bitbadgesAddress = ethToBitBadges(address);
</strong>const ethAddress = bitbadgesToEth(bitbadgesAddress);
const bitbadgesAddressFromSolana = solanaToBitBadges(address);
//Note there is no bitbadgesToSolana or ethToSolana due to how the addresses work
</code></pre>

#### **How do I query details for an address?**

1. You can use the [BitBadges API](../bitbadges-api/api.md) to get information about an address (recommended option). This is the recommended options because we have indexed all the data already for you.
2. You an also query a BitBadges blockchain node directly, either through the CLI or  [REST API ](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/interact-node.html).&#x20;
