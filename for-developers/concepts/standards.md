# ðŸ–Š Standards

Standards are a generic concept that allows anyone to define how to interpret the details of a badge collection. All collections will implement the same interface on the blockchain (see [Collections](broken-reference)), but the standard defines how these fields are interpreted and are expected to be defined. Standards can define anything from the expected genesis conditions to the expected metadata format.

For example, a non-fungible standard may enforce that the max supply of any badge never exceeds one. Or, a non-deletable standard may enforce that the delete collection permission is never enabled. Or, an attendance-badge standard might define a specific metadata format that is niche to attendance-based events only.&#x20;

You can define and implement multiple standards, as long as they are compatible.

IMPORTANT: There is no check in the blockchain logic that a specific standard is actually followed. The value stored on the blockchain is purely informational and for guidelines. It is your responsibility to double check standards are being followed correctly and take action accordingly.

### Adding New Standards

We want to decentralize the process of creating new standards and open it up to everyone. The comprehensive list of standards can be found on this page below. If you would like to author a new standard and have it added, contact us.

### Format

Each standard must follow the following format:

**Author:** John Doe

**Standard ID:** 0

**Version:** 0.0.1

**Standard Details:** The standard details outline the expected functionality of badges who implement this standard.



## List of Standards

### BitBadges Base Metadata Standard (ID: 0)

**Author**: The BitBadges Team

**Standard ID**: 0

**Version**: 0.0.1 (Last Updated: 4/12/2023)

**Standard Details:**&#x20;

The BitBadges Website standard defines the expected format of badge metadata that is to be supported on the BitBadges website.&#x20;

* Metadata: Both collection and badge metadata will specify a URI which hosts a JSON file that implements the following interface below. If the badge metadata URI includes "{id}" anywhere in the URI, it is to be replaced dynamically by the corresponding badge ID number.

```typescript
export interface Metadata<T extends NumberType> {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  time?: UintRange<T>;
  validFrom?: UintRange<T>;
  color?: string;
  category?: string;
  externalUrl?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  hidden?: boolean;
  references?: string[];
}
```

* Off-Chain Balances Metadata: If your collection uses the off-chain balances type, the URI of the offChainBalancesMetadata should point to a JSON file which is a map of valid cosmosAddresses -> [Balance](balances.md) objects.
* Claim Metadata: TODO
