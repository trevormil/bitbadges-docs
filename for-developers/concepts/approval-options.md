# âœ… Approval Options

In the last page, we mainly talked about how we match and check an approved transfer. Here, we will talk about the **approvalDetails.**&#x20;

These are the additional options or restrictions you can set which decide whether a transfer is approved or not (e.g. how much can be transferred? how many times? etc). To be approved, it must satisfy all the options / restrictions set.

```typescript
export interface ApprovalDetails<T extends NumberType> {
  approvalId: string;
  uri: string;
  customData: string;

  mustOwnBadges: MustOwnBadges<T>[];
  merkleChallenges: MerkleChallenge<T>[];
  predeterminedBalances: PredeterminedBalances<T>;
  approvalAmounts: ApprovalAmounts<T>;
  maxNumTransfers: MaxNumTransfers<T>;

  requireToEqualsInitiatedBy: boolean;
  requireFromEqualsInitiatedBy: boolean;
  requireToDoesNotEqualInitiatedBy: boolean;
  requireFromDoesNotEqualInitiatedBy: boolean;

  overridesFromApprovedOutgoingTransfers: boolean;
  overridesToApprovedIncomingTransfers: boolean;
}
```



Important Notes:

* **approvalDetails** is an array of approvals. Most should typically only use one approval (len == 1). Having multiple approvals is advanced functionality: see the advanced sections below.
* Approval details are NOT included in the first-match algorithm described in [approved transfers](approval-options.md). This may take careful design when defining approvals. For example, approvalDetails4 below will never be matched to.
  * `(bob, alice, bob, 10, [1-2], [1000-2000]) -> (true, approvalDetails1[])`
  * `(bob, alice, bob, 10, [1-2], [10-50]) -> (true, approvalDetails2[])`
  * `(bob, alice, bob, 10, [1-2], [51-100]) -> (true, approvalDetails3[])`
  * `(bob, alice, bob, 10, [1-2], [10-100]) -> (true, approvalDetails4[])`
* The amounts approved in approvalDetails are limited to the badgeIds and ownershipTimes of the transfer tuple it is mapped from. For example, approvalDetails3\[] above can only approve badge IDs 1-2 and ownership times 51-100. Anything approved outside that (such as badge ID 3) will be ignored or throw an error. Again, this means you need to design carefully.
* These are just the native options provided for convenience and consistency. You can always extend this via custom logic with a smart contract. For example, set an approval that can only be initiated by the contract. Then, handle all custom approval logic in the CosmWASM contract and have the contract initiate the MsgTransferBadges call.

### **Approval ID**

Approval IDs are simply a string identifier for the approval and must be unique per approved transfers timeline per address (collection-wide approved transfers are also considered a unique approved transfers timeline).&#x20;

The approval IDs are used by the blockchain to fetch / store / tally the number of transfers and amounts transferred for the approval (if applicable).

So, if a user's incoming approved transfers uses an approval ID that is also in their outgoing approved transfers, this is fine because they are on different timelines ("collection", "incoming", "outgoing"). These IDs will have no overlap. But, a user's incoming approvals cannot specify two with the same approval ID.&#x20;

### **Approval Amount Tallies**

Approval amounts (**approvalAmounts**) specifies the threshold amount that can be transferred for this approval. This is similar to other interfaces (such as approvals for ERC721).&#x20;

Whenever a transfer matches an approval which specifies a threshold approval amount, we increment a running tally of the cumulative amounts transferred and assert it does not exceed the specified threshold. This is implemented slightly different than other token interfaces, which often decrement the threshold directly. We increment the tally.

We define four levels that you can specify for approval amounts as seen below. You can define multiple if desired. To be approved, the transfer must satisfy all that are specified.&#x20;

* **Overall**: Overall will increment the cumulative tally for all transfers that match this approval, regardless of who sends, receives, or initiates them.
* **Per To Address**: If you specify an approval amount per to address, we will create unique cumulative tallies for every unique "to" address.&#x20;
  * Ex: Each unique address can only receive x1 of badge ID 1
* **Per From Address**: Creates unique cumulative tallies for every unique "from" address.&#x20;
* **Per Initiated By Address**: Creates unique cumulative tallies for every unique "initiatedBy" address.&#x20;

### **Max Number of Transfers**

Similar to approval amounts, you can also specify the maximum number of transfers that can occur. This similarly creates an incrementing tally on four levels (overall, per-to address, per-from address, and per-initiatedBy address). Each transfer increments the tally by one, and we assert that we do not exceed the maximum number of transfers.

Storage is the same as approval amounts (e.g. increment only, only increments if specified, non-deletable, unique per timeline per approval ID, etc). See the section above.

The only difference is that we also may need the number of transfers to calculate the predetermined balances (see below). If we do need this, we also increment the number of transfers (even if the corresponding maximum number of transfers for that level is not set / set to no limit).

### **Calculating Tallys**

We calculate tallys on an as-needed basis. Meaning, if the amount is nil or zero, we assume that there are no restrictions and will automatically be approved for that level and do not track any tally for that level. Take this into consideration, especially if you change from unlimited restrictions to some restriction. It is not retroactive and only is tallied for transfers while it has a restriction.

Each level described above will also create a unique tally. A "per to" addresses tally for Bob will be a different tally than the "per from" addresses tally for Bob. The "per to" one will only increment when Bob is the "to" address, and the "per from" will only increment when Bob is the "from" address.&#x20;

Tallies are also unique to each approval ID. So, an "overall" tally for approval ID 123 will be different than the overall tally for approval ID ABC. Each tally is increment-only and non-deletable. If you would like to reset the state of the tally, a new unused approval ID can be specified which will create brand new tallies.&#x20;

IMPORTANT: note that we only increment tallies if a threshold amount is currently defined. For example, if no "per to" address threshold is defined, we will not increment / create a tally. If you later set a "per to" address threshold, it is not retroactive and will start the tally from zero.

### **Predetermined Balances**

Predetermined balances are a new way of having fine-grained control over the amounts that are approved with each transfer.&#x20;

In a tally-based system where you approve X amount to be transferred, you have no control over the combination of amounts that will add up to X. For example, if you approve x100, you can't control whether the transfers are \[x1, x1, x98] or \[x100] or another combination.

Predetermined balances let you explicitly define the amounts that must be transferred and the order of the transfers. For example, you can enforce x1 of badge ID 1 has to be transferred before x1 of badge ID 2, and so on.

There are two ways to define the balances. Either one or the other method must be used but not together.

* **Manual Balances:** Simply define an array of balances manually.&#x20;
* **Incremented Balances:** Define starting balances and then define how much to increment the IDs and times by after each transfer. This is how to implement the above example: you can enforce x1 of badge ID 1 has to be transferred before x1 of badge ID 2, and so on.

The order is calculated by a specified order calculation method. For manual balances, this corresponds to the element index of the array (e.g. order number = 0 means first balances element in array). For incremented balances, this corresponds to how many times we should increment (e.g. order number = 5 means apply the increments to the starting balances five times).

There are five calculation methods. We either use a running tally of the number of transfers to calculate the order number (no previous transfers = order number 0, one previous = order number 1, and so on). This can be done on an overall or per to/from/initiatedBy address basis, similar to the approval amounts and maximum number of transfers.&#x20;

We also support using the leaf index for a Merkle proof to calculate the order number (e.g. leftmost leaf will correspond to order number 0, next leaf will be order number 1, and so on). The leftmost leaf means the leftmost leaf of the expectedProofLength layer, and we use the challenge which has useLeafIndexForTransferOrder set to true (see Merkle Challenges below). Exactly one challenge must have useLeafIndexForTransferOrder set to true if using this option.

This can be used to reserve specific badges for specific users / claim codes. For example, reserve the badges corresponding to order number 10 for address xyz.eth.

```typescript
export interface PredeterminedOrderCalculationMethod {
  useOverallNumTransfers: boolean;
  usePerToAddressNumTransfers: boolean;
  usePerFromAddressNumTransfers: boolean;
  usePerInitiatedByAddressNumTransfers: boolean;
  useMerkleChallengeLeafIndex: boolean;
}
```

Although this can be used in tandem with approval amounts, either one or the other is usually used because they both specify amount restrictions.

### **Must Own Badges**

Must own badges are another unique feature that is very powerful. This allows you to specify certain badges and amounts of badges of another collection that must be owned at custom times in order to be approved. &#x20;

For example, you may implement a badge collection where only holders of a verified badge are approved to send and receive badges. Or, you may implement what you must NOT own a scammer badge in order to interact.

Note that collections with "Off-Chain" balances are not supported for this feature. For "Inherited" balances, this must be implemented in the root parent collection.

### **Merkle Challenges**

Merkle challenges allow you to define a SHA256 Merkle tree, and to be approved for each transfer, the initiator of the transfer must provide a valid Merkle path for the tree.&#x20;

For example, you can create a Merkle tree of claim codes. Then to be able to claim badges, each claimee must provide a valid Merkle path from the claim code to the **root**.

The **expectedProofLength** defines the expected length for the Merkle proofs to be provided. This is to avoid preimage and second preimage attacks. All proofs must be of the correct length, which means you must design your trees accordingly.

We also support a couple customization options. First, you can set **useCreatorAddressAsLeaf**. If set, we will override the provided leaf of each Merkle proof with the msg.creator aka the address of the initiator of the transaction. This can be used to implement whitelist trees. Note that the initiator must also be within the initiatedByMapping of the approval for it to make sense.

The **maxOneUsePerLeaf** is important to be set if you want to prevent against replay attacks. For example, ensure that a code / proof can only be used once.

Similar to approval IDs, the challenge IDs are unique per approved transfers timeline. If **maxOneUsePerLeaf** is specified, we create a store identified by the challenge ID which tracks which leaf has been used or not. This is increment-only and non-deletable. To reset the state, you must provide a new unused challenge ID. Challenge IDs can be reused across the same timeline (in different approvals). This means that we use the same store (which leaf has been used) for all the corresponding approvals, but this is not recommended because it can cause confusion.&#x20;

```typescript
export interface MerkleChallenge<T extends NumberType> {
  root: string
  expectedProofLength: T;
  useCreatorAddressAsLeaf: boolean
  maxOneUsePerLeaf: boolean
  useLeafIndexForTransferOrder: boolean
  challengeId: string
  uri: string
  customData: string
}
```

### **Requires**

You also have the following options to further restrict who can transfer to who. Note that this is only applicable to the addresses that match in the respective mappings for to, from, and initiatedBy.

**requireToEqualsInitiatedBy, requireToDoesNotEqualsInitiatedBy**

**requireFromEqualsInitiatedBy, requireFromDoesNotEqualsInitiatedBy**

These are pretty self-explanatory. You can enforce that we additionally check if the to or from address equals or does not equal the initiator of the transfer.

### **Overrides**

As mentioned, the collection-wide approvals can override the user-level approvals. This is done via the **overridesFromApprovedOutgoingTransfers** or **overridesToApprovedIncomingTransfers**.&#x20;

If this respective approval is matched to with an override flag set to true, we will not check the user approvals for the matched criteria. If override flag is not set, we will have to check that it is also approved on the user level.

### Advanced: Multiple Approval Details

In some instances, you may need more than one approval in the approvalDetails array. For example, if you are on whitelist ABC, approve x10 of IDs 1-100 and if you are on whitelist DEF, approve x1000 of IDs 1-100 (with all other criteria is the same).

**Order of Execution**

If you have multiple approvals in the approvalDetails array, the easiest way to handle this is simply to design in a way that there is no overlap and all criteria is mutually exclusive. So given a transfer transaction that maps to the approvalDetail array, there is only one valid match in the whole array. If you do this, you do not need to worry about unexpected behavior.

For example, these are mutually exclusive because if you are in whitelist ABC, you will always map to the first. If you are in DEF, you map to the second.

```json
[{
    Tally ID: 123
    Approve x5 of IDs 1-10 if you are on whitelist ABC (merkle whitelist),
}, {
    Tally ID: 123,
    Approve x10 of IDs 1-10 if you are on whitelist DEF (merkle whitelist)
}]
```

However, if there is overlap in the conditions, we resolve with a linear scan for the first FULL match. This means that we do not attempt to overflow from one approval to the next. It must be satisfied FULLY.

So for example, lets say we have the following

```json
[{
    Tally ID: 123
    Approve x5 of IDs 1-10 if you satisfy criteria ABC,
}, {
    Tally ID: 123,
    Approve x10 of IDs 1-10 if you satisfy criteria ABC
}]
```

Attempting to transfer \[x10 of IDs 1-10] would mean the first x5 approval is not fully satisfied so we continue to the x10 where it is satisfied.&#x20;

Attempting to transfer \[x11 of IDs 1-10] would satisfy neither.

As seen, this can get confusing and cause behavior that isn't entirely what one may expect. This is why we **strongly recommend** designing in a way that criteria is always mutually exclusive. We plan to work on a better solution for overlapping criteria in the future.

### **Advanced: Linking Approvals**

You can link approvals using the challenge and tallying ID mechanisms. As explained above, we keep track of approvals and used leaves using an incrementing tally system where each tally is identified by an ID.&#x20;

These IDs are not limited to a single approval and can be used multiple times across a timeline. If multiple approvals / challenges have the same ID, the tally corresponding to that ID will be incremented whenever ANY of the approvals / challenges are satisfied. Thus, it increases the tally for ALL the approvals / challenges.&#x20;

Note that this is applied on a per-timeline basis. We consider the collection approved transfers a unique timeline. A specific user's incoming approval timeline is also different from their outgoin approval's timeline.

**Example 1:**

For example, the following pseudocode for approvalDetails would allow address C (in both whitelist ABC and CDE) to claim a max of x10 because the tallys are linked.

```json
[{
    Tally ID: 123
    Approve x5 of IDs 1-10 if you are on whitelist ABC,
}, {
    Tally ID: 123,
    Approve x10 of IDs 1-10 if you are on whitelist CDE
}]
```

But, the following would allow address C to claim a max of x15 because the tally for x10 and x5 are not linked.

```json
[{
    Tally ID: 123
    Approve x5 of IDs 1-10 if you are on whitelist ABC,
}, {
    Tally ID: 456,
    Approve x10 of IDs 1-10 if you are on whitelist CDE
}]
```

**Example 2:** Lets say you want to create an approval where a user must either own badge ID 1 from collection 1 or own badge ID 1 from collection 2 but they cannot own both (so XOR logic). You could do something like this:

```json
[{
    Tally ID: 123
    Approve x5 of IDs 1-10 if:
        A) you own >1 of badge ID 1 from collection 1 
        B) you own x0 of badge ID 1 from collection 2
}, {
    Tally ID: 123,
    Approve x5 of IDs 1-10 if:
        A) you own >1 of badge ID 1 from collection 2 
        B) you own x0 of badge ID 1 from collection 1
}]
```

Even though these are two separate approvals, they are inherently linked via the tally ID.
