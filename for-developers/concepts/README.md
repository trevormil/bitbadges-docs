# 👥 Concepts

This section covers core BitBadges concepts that developers need to understand when building with the platform.

## Account System

BitBadges uses Cosmos-based accounts with 'bb' prefixed bech32 addresses. All users interact with tokens and services using Cosmos-compatible wallets and Cosmos signatures.

For more details on how BitBadges supports addresses from different blockchains (including Ethereum) and how to convert between address formats, see [Accounts](accounts.md).
