# Msg Examples

For more examples about how the interface works, check the resources below. Feel free to reach out if any questions.

Resources:

* You can see transactions directly by querying the blockchain. Via the BitBadges site:
  * Visit the Update History tab for seeing all MsgUpdateCollection transactions.&#x20;
  * For MsgTransferBadges, go to the transfer activity -> see transaction. Note it must be an on-chain balances collection.
  * For approvals, go to a user's approvals on the Approvals tab -> Update History tab.
* You can also play around with the JSON / dev mode feature on the BitBadges site. On the final step before submitting a tx, you can click see JSON to see what it looks like behind the scenes.
* You can also use https://bitbadges.io/dev/broacast for a custom transaction builder.
