# ðŸ’» BitBadges Frontend

The BitBadges website is an open-source and user-friendly way for users to interact with the BitBadges blockchain, as well as offering many features not natively supported by the blockchain.&#x20;

GitHub: [https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadges-frontend](https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadges-frontend)

Feel free to fork this as a starting point for a custom frontend!

The goal for this website is to be the all-in-one site for any crypto user. We want anyone to be able to view everything about an address and their on-chain reputation. While some features will be created by us, we want to integrate and support the most popular projects from all chains (not just BitBadges chain). Win-win mindset.&#x20;
