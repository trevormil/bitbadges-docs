# 🃏 Aliases

Alias addresses are a simple concept used for collections and address lists. Basically, they are a non-claimable account that can receive badges. Thus, they have a portfolio and everything. However, they can never generate or submit transactions. This can be leveraged if you would like a collection to own a badge, such as a scam badge or a trustworthy badge. You just send the badge to the alias address.

Alias addresses are slightly longer than traditional Cosmos addresses.
