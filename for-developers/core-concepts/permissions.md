# üîê Permissions

First, read [Permissions](../../overview/how-it-works/manager.md) for an overview.

Note: The [Approved Transfers](transferability-approvals.md) and [Permissions ](../../overview/how-it-works/manager.md)are the most powerful features of the interface, but they can also be the most confusing. For further examples, please reference the [Learn the Interface](../create-and-broadcast-txs/msg-examples.md) section. Please ask for help if needed.

<pre class="language-json"><code class="lang-json"><strong>"collectionPermissions": {
</strong>    "canDeleteCollection": [...],
    "canArchiveCollection": [...],
    "canUpdateOffChainBalancesMetadata": [...],
    "canUpdateStandards": [...],
    "canUpdateCustomData": [...],
    "canUpdateManager": [...],
    "canUpdateCollectionMetadata": [...],
    "canCreateMoreBadges": [...],
    "canUpdateBadgeMetadata": [...],
    "canUpdateCollectionApprovals": [...]
}
</code></pre>

```json
"userPermissions": {
    "canUpdateIncomingApprovals": [...],
    "canUpdateOutgoingApprovals": [...],
    "canUpdateAutoApproveSelfInitiatedOutgoingTransfers": [...],
    "canUpdateAutoApproveSelfInitiatedIncomingTransfers": [...],
}
```

The **canUpdateIncomingApprovals** and **canUpdateOutgoingApprovals** follow the same interface as **canUpdateCollectionApprovals** minus automatically populating the user's address for to / from for incoming / outgoing, respectively. We only explain the collection approval permission to avoid repetition.

```typescript
export interface ActionPermission<T extends NumberType> {
  permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
}
```

```typescript
export interface TimedUpdatePermission<T extends NumberType> {
  timelineTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  
  permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
}
```

```typescript
export interface TimedUpdateWithBadgeIdsPermission<T extends NumberType> {
  timelineTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  badgeIds: UintRange<T>[];
  
  permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
}
```

```typescript
export interface BalancesActionPermission<T extends NumberType> {
  badgeIds: UintRange<T>[];
  ownershipTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  
  permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
}
```

```typescript
export interface CollectionApprovalPermission<T extends NumberType> {
  fromListId: string;
  toListId: string;
  initiatedByListId: string;
  transferTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  badgeIds: UintRange<T>[];
  ownershipTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  approvalId: string
  approvalTrackerId: string
  challengeTrackerId: string
  
  permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
  permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
}
```

### Manager

The collectionPermissions only apply to the current manager of the collection. In other words, the manager is the only one who is able to execute permissions. If there is no manager for a collection, no permissions can be executed.

The current manager is determined by the **managerTimeline.** Transferring the manager is facilitated via the **canUpdateManager** permission.

```json
"managerTimeline": [
  {
    "manager": "cosmos1kfr2xajdvs46h0ttqadu50nhu8x4v0tcfn4p0x",
    "timelineTimes": [
      {
        "start": 1,
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### **Permitted and Forbidden Times**

Permissions allow you to define permitted or forbidden times to be able to execute a permission.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**States**

There are three states that a permission can be in at any one time:

1. **Forbidden + Permanently Frozen (permanentlyForbiddenTimes):** This permission is forbidden and will always remain forbidden.
   1. If a permission is explicitly allowed via the **permanentlyPermittedTimes, it will ALWAYS be allowed** during those permanentlyPermittedTimes (can't change it).
2. **Permitted + Not Frozen (Unhandled):** This permission is currently permitted but can be changed to one of the other two states.
   1. If not explicitly permitted or forbidden - NEUTRAL (not defined or unhandled), **permissions are ALLOWED by default** but can later be set to be permanently allowed or disallowed. There is no "forbidden currently but updatable" state.
3. **Permitted + Permanently Frozen (permanentlyPermittedTimes):** This permission is forbidden and will always remain permitted
   1. If a permission is explicitly forbidden via the **permanentlyForbiddenTimes, it will ALWAYS be disallowed** during those permanentlyForbiddenTimes.

There is no forbidden + not frozen state because theoretically, it could be updated to permitted at any time and executed (thus making it permitted).

**Examples**

This means the permission is permanently forbidden and frozen.

```typescriptreact
permanentlyPermittedTimes: []
permanentlyForbiddenTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
```

This means it is permanently allowed and frozen.

```typescriptreact
permanentlyForbiddenTimes: []
permanentlyPermittedTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
```

This means it is allowed currently but neutral and can be changed to be always permitted or always forbidden in the future.

```
permanentlyForbiddenTimes: []
permanentlyPermittedTimes: []
```

### First Match Policy

All permissions are a linear array where each element may have some criteria as well as **permanentlyForbiddenTimes** or **permanentlyPermittedTimes.** It can be interpreted as if the criteria matches, the permission is permitted or forbidden according to the defined times, respectively.

We do not allow times to be in both the permanentlyPermittedTimes and permanentlyForbiddenTimes array simultaneously.

**Unlike approvals, we only allow taking the first match in the case criteria satisfies multiple elements in the permissions array.** All subsequent matches are ignored. This makes it so that for any time and for each criteria combination, there is a deterministic permission state (permitted, forbidden, or neutral). This means you have to carefully design your permissions because order and overlaps matter.

Ex: If we have the following permission definitions in an array \[elem1, elem2]:

1. ```
   timelineTimes: [{ start: 1, end: 10 }]

   permanentlyPermittedTimes: []
   permanentlyForbiddenTimes: [{ start: 1, end: 10 }]
   ```
2. ```
   timelineTimes: [{ start: 1, end: 100 }]

   permanentlyForbiddenTimes: []
   permanentlyPermittedTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
   ```

In this case, the timeline times 1-10 will be forbidden ONLY from times 1-10 because we take the first element that matches for that specific criteria (which is permanentlyPermittedTimes: \[], permanentlyForbiddenTimes: \[1 to 10]).

Times 11-100 would be permanently permitted since the first match for those times is the second element.

Similar to approved transfers, even though we allow range logic to be specified, we first expand everything maintaining order to their singular values (one value, no ranges) before checking for our first match.

### Satisfying Criteria

All criteria must be satisfied for it to be a match. For example, for the **canCreateMoreBadges** permission, the criteria involves which badge IDs can the manager create more of and at what times can they be owned (circulating times).

```
badgeIds: [{ start: 1, end: 10 }]
ownershipTimes: [{ start 1, end: 10 }]

permanentlyForbiddenTimes: []
permanentlyPermittedTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
```

This would result in the manager being able to create more of badges IDs 1-10 which can be owned from times 1-10.

However, this permission **does not** specify whether they can create more of badge ID 1 at time 11 or badge ID 11 at time 1. These combinations are considered unhandled or not defined by the permission definition above.

**Common Misunderstanding**

A common misunderstanding is that if the permission below is appended after the above one, this would forbid badges 11+ from ever being created. However, creating badge IDs 11+ at times 11+ would still be unhandled and allowed by default.

```
badgeIds: [{ start: 11, end: Max }]
ownershipTimes: [{ start 1, end: 10 }]

permanentlyForbiddenTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
permanentlyPermittedTimes: []
```

To permanently forbid all badgeIds, you must brute force ALL other combinations such as

```
badgeIds: [{ start: 11, end: Max }]
ownershipTimes: [{ start: 1, end: Max }] // 1-10 never gets matched to bc of first match
//can also do start: 11

permanentlyForbiddenTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
permanentlyPermittedTimes: []
```

**Approved Transfers Criteria**

For approval permissions like below, this would mean that updating any approval from the "Mint" address is permanently forbidden. However, it does not apply to approvals from any other address, even if all other N-1 criteria is satisfied.

Also, if we add another permission definition after this one in the array with **fromListId** = "Mint", this would never be matched to because the first one brute forces all possible combinations, so first match always matches to this one.

```json
"canUpdateCollectionApprovals": [
  {
    "fromListId": "Mint",
    "toListId": "AllWithMint",
    "initiatedByListId": "AllWithMint",
    "timelineTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "transferTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "badgeIds": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "ownershipTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "approvalId": "All",
    "approvalTrackerId": "All",
    "challengeTrackerId": "All",
    "permanentlyPermittedTimes": [],
    "permanentlyForbiddenTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### **Importance of Handling All Values**

Let's say we have the following **where** we do not handle badge ID 1.

```
"canUpdateCollectionApprovals": [
  {
    "fromListId": "AllWithMint",
    "toListId": "AllWithMint",
    "initiatedByListId": "AllWithMint",
    "timelineTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "transferTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "badgeIds": [
      {
        "start": "2",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "ownershipTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ],
    "approvalId": "All",
    "approvalTrackerId": "All",
    "challengeTrackerId": "All",
    "permanentlyPermittedTimes": [],
    "permanentlyForbiddenTimes": [
      {
        "start": "1",
        "end": "18446744073709551615"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Even though all other combinations are unhandled, we can create / update any approval of badge ID 1 because it is unhandled and allowed (neutral) by default.

### **Permission Categories**

There are five categories of permissions, each with different criteria that must be matched with. If you get confused with the different time types, refer to [Different Time Types](different-time-fields.md) for examples and explanations.

```json
"canDeleteCollection": [], //ActionPermission[]
"canArchiveCollection": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canUpdateContractAddress": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canUpdateOffChainBalancesMetadata": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canUpdateStandards": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canUpdateCustomData": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canUpdateManager": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canUpdateCollectionMetadata": [], //TimedUpdatePermission[]
"canCreateMoreBadges": [], //BalancesActionPermission[]
"canUpdateBadgeMetadata": [], //TimedUpdateWithBadgeIdsPermission[]
"canUpdateCollectionApprovals": [] //ApprovedTransferPermission[]
```

```json
"canUpdateIncomingApprovals": [], //ApprovedTransferPermission[] (w/o to fields)
"canUpdateOutgoingApprovals": [], //ApprovedTransferPermission[] (w/o from fields)
"canUpdateAutoApproveSelfInitiatedOutgoingTransfers": [], //ActionPermission[]
"canUpdateAutoApproveSelfInitiatedIncomingTransfers": [], //ActionPermission[]
```

* **ActionPermission**: Simplest (no criteria). Just denotes what times the action is executable or not.
  * <pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>{
    </strong>  permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
      permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
    }
    </code></pre>
* **TimedUpdatePermission**: For what timelineTimes, can the manager update the scheduled value?
  * timelineTimes corresponds to the scheduled times of a timeline-based value such as badge metadata or collection metadata. The permanentlyPermittedTimes and permanentlyForbiddenTimes correspond to when the manager can update such values.
  * ```typescript
    {
      timelineTimes: UintRange<T>[];
      
      permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
      permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
    }
    ```
* **TimedUpdateWithBadgeIdsPermission**: For what timelineTimes / badge ID combinations can I update the scheduled value?
  * ```typescript
    {
      timelineTimes: UintRange<T>[];
      badgeIds: UintRange<T>[];
      
      permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
      permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
    }
    ```
* **BalancesActionPermission**: For what badge ID / ownershipTimes combinations can the manager execute the permission?
  * ```typescript
    {
      badgeIds: UintRange<T>[];
      ownershipTimes: UintRange<T>[];
      
      permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange<T>[];
      permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange<T>[];
    }
    ```
* **ApprovalPermission**: For what timeline times AND what transfer combinations (see [Representing Transfers](transferability-approvals.md)), can I update the approval criteria? See section below for further details.
  * **IDs:** The IDs are used for locking specific approvals or trackers. This is because sometimes it may not be sufficient to just lock a specific (from, to, initiator, time, badge IDs, ownershipTimes) combination due to multiple approvals matching the same criteria.
  * **ID Shorthand Options:** Note that we also reserve the "!" prefix for inverting a given list ID and also reserve specific list IDs (see [Address Lists](address-lists-lists.md)). The same shorthand options can be applied to the ID fields ("!id123" means all IDs except "id123"). Use "All" to represent all IDs.
  * Ex: I cannot update the approvals for the combinations ("All", "All", "All", 1-100, 1-10, 1-10, "All",  "All",  "All") tuple, thus making the transferability locked for those transfer combinations.
    * <pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript"><strong>{
      </strong>  fromListId: string;
        toListId: string;
        initiatedByListId: string;
        transferTimes: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
        badgeIds: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
        ownershipTimes: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
        approvalId: string
        amountTrackerId: string
        challengeTrackerId: string
        
        
        permanentlyPermittedTimes: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
        permanentlyForbiddenTimes: UintRange&#x3C;T>[];
      }
      </code></pre>

### **Approval Permissions**

**ID Shorthands**

To specify IDs, you can use the "All" reserved ID to represent all IDs, or you can use other shorthand methods such as "!xyz" to denote all IDs but xyz. These shorthands are the same as reserved lists, so we refer you[ there for more info](address-lists-lists.md). Just replace the addresses with the IDs.

**Freezing Specific Values - Main Fields**

For the main fields (to, from, initiator, badge IDs, transfer times, ownership times), you can freeze specific values, such as freeze all badge IDs 2-10. If you do this, all approvals for the specific badge IDs will remain as currently set, but the following would still be allowed due to the break down logic we use.

Permission: Badge IDs 2-10 are locked

Before: 1-10 -> Criteria ABC

After: 1 -> Criteria XYZ, 2-10 -> Criteria ABC

```json
{
  "fromListId": "AllWithMint",
  "toListId": "AllWithMint",
  "initiatedByListId": "AllWithMint",
  "badgeIds":  [{ "start": "2", "end": "10" }],
  "transferTimes":  [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }],
  "ownershipTimes":  [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }],
  "approvalId": "All", //forbids approval "xyz" from being updated
  "amountTrackerId": "All",
  "challengeTrackerId": "All",
  "permanentlyPermittedTimes": [],
  "permanentlyForbiddenTimes": [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }]
}
```

**Freezing a Specific Approval - IDs / Trackers**

Enforcing a specific approval is frozen is dependent on whether all logic is scoped to the current approval (**amountTrackerId** = **approvalId** = **challengeTrackerId**) or the approval potentially implements cross-approval logic (**amountTrackerId** != **approvalId** or **approvalId** != **challengeTrackerId**). These refer to the actual approval values, not permission values.

IMPORTANT: If your approval potentially implements cross-approval logic, we refer you [here](approval-criteria/linking-trackers-advanced.md). T

If your logic is scoped  (**amountTrackerId** = **approvalId** = **challengeTrackerId**), you can enforce that a specific approval is frozen and cannot be updated by simply brute forcing all combinations with that specific approval ID (see below for freezing approval "xyz"). You could also fine-grain it as well (e.g. lock IDs 1-10 within this specific approval but allow 11+ to still be updated). However, typically freezing approvals are all-or-nothing.

Note that if you just brute force a single approval ID as seen below, this will have no bearing on whether other approvals with the same badge IDs, senders, recipients, etc are created. It just freezes that specific approval.

```json
{
  "fromListId": "AllWithMint",
  "toListId": "AllWithMint",
  "initiatedByListId": "AllWithMint",
  "badgeIds":  [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }],
  "transferTimes":  [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }],
  "ownershipTimes":  [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }],
  "approvalId": "xyz", //forbids approval "xyz" from being updated
  "amountTrackerId": "All",
  "challengeTrackerId": "All",
  "permanentlyPermittedTimes": [],
  "permanentlyForbiddenTimes": [{ "start": "1", "end": "18446744073709551615" }]
}
```

Note that this freezes a specific approval only in the case of scoped logic  (**amountTrackerId** = **approvalId** = **challengeTrackerId**) because of the restriction that tracker IDs cannot equal the approval ID of a different approval. Thus, since the **approvalId** is locked and (**amountTrackerId** = **approvalId** = **challengeTrackerId**) and no other approvals can use this approval's tracker IDs, the approval is locked and behavior will always stay as expected. If it wasn't scoped, the above permission would still allow other approvals to be created with the same tracker IDs which could mess up the behavior of the current approval, as explained [here](approval-criteria/linking-trackers-advanced.md).

### **User Permissions**

Besides the collection permissions, there are also userPermissions that can be set.

```json
"userPermissions": {
    "canUpdateIncomingApprovals": [],
    "canUpdateOutgoingApprovals": [],
    "canUpdateAutoApproveSelfInitiatedOutgoingTransfers": [],
    "canUpdateAutoApproveSelfInitiatedIncomingTransfers": [],
}
```

Typically, these will remain empty, so that the user can always have full control over their approvals. If empty, they are permitted by default (but not frozen).&#x20;

However, setting user permissions can be leveraged in some cases for specific purposes.

* Locking that a specific badge can never be transferred out of the account
* Locking that a specific approval is always set and uneditable so that two mutually distrusting parties can use the address as an escrow

**Defaults**

We give the option for the collection to define default permissions. These will be used as the starting values when the balance is initially created in storage. This can be used in tandem with the other defaults. The default permissions are also not typically used, but again can be used in certain situations. For example,

* By default, approve all incoming transfers and lock the permission so all transfers always have incoming approvals and can never be disapproved.

### **Permissions vs Actual Values**

Note that the update permissions (**ApprovalPermissions, TimedUpdatePermission,** and **TimedUpdateWithBadgeIdsPermission)** correspond to the UPDATABILITY of the values and are separate from the actual values themselves. The permission does not correlate to what the currently set values are.

Similarly with the **BalancesActionPermission**, it has no bearing on what the currently minted supplys are. It refers to the EXECUTABILITY of creating new badges.

For example, if **canCreateMoreBadges** is set to this

<pre><code><strong>badgeIds: [{ start: 1, end: 10 }]
</strong>ownershipTimes: [{ start 1, end: 10 }]

permanentlyForbiddenTimes: [{ start: 1, end: GO_MAX_UINT_64 }]
permanentlyPermittedTimes: []
</code></pre>

it has no bearing on what the current circulating supplys are, but it says that whatever they are currently, no more of IDs 1-10 for times 1-10 can be created.
