# ‚úç Custom Data

The **customDataTimeline** is a generic timeline that allows you to store anything you want. We do not use custom data anywhere for the BitBadges site or other code, but we envision it can potentially be used for creating different standards and storing arbitrary data.

We also pair every **uri** field with a **customData** field. Again, we do not use it, but we believed it was important to have a place to store arbitrary data on-chain, in case you wanted a fully on-chain solution. For example, store metadata via **customData** rather than fetched off-chain via a **uri**.
