# Overview

BitBadges offers an L1 delegated proof-of-stake blockchain built with [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main). The blockchain is able to attain instant transaction finality using Tendermint and supports both Cosmos-based 'bb' prefixed bech32 addresses with Cosmos signatures, as well as Ethereum-compatible addresses (0x-prefixed) with EVM signatures through precompile contracts.

The source code can be found at [https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadgeschain](https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadgeschain).&#x20;

BitBadges defines its official metadata, IBC connections, and more in the Cosmos chain registry at  [https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry).
