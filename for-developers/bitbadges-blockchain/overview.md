# Overview

BitBadges offers an L1 delegated proof-of-stake blockchain built with [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main) and [Ignite CLI](https://docs.ignite.com/) that enables the natively multi-chain issuance of digital tokens (e.g. an Ethereum user can seamlessly issue a badge to a Cosmos user and vice versa). The blockchain is able to attain instant transaction finality using Tendermint and natively supports users from multiple Layer 1 blockchains (Ethereum,  Bitcoin, Cosmos, Solana) via IBC and account lists.

The source code can be found at [https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadgeschain](https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadgeschain). The blockchain supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and CosmWASM.

**Goal**

Build a dynamic, multi-chain token interface on the blockchain that can support all functionalities of tokens and do it in the most efficient way possible. We will continuously adapt this interface until it can support any and all use cases. The end goal is that no smart contract is ever needed to be created. Although for now, tokens can be extended with smart contracts (CosmWASM) for unsupported functionality.

**Current Supported Chains**

Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Bitcoin
