# Staking / Validators

## **Staking**

The BitBadges blockchain is a [delegated proof-of-stake blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/proof-of-stake-vs-delegated-proof-of-stake/). Behind the scenes, this uses the [Cosmos SDK staking](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/staking) module. To stake, visit [https://bitbadges.io/stake](https://bitbadges.io/stake) or our explorer.

## **Governance**

For important decisions, we use the Cosmos governance proposal module. Validators vote on decisions according to their voting power.
