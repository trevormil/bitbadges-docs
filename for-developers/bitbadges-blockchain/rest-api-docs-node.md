# REST API Docs - Node

Swagger API Documentation for REST API of a BitBadges Node: [http://134.122.12.165:1317/.](http://134.122.12.165:1317/). This is an alias of http://node.bitbadges.io:1317 but that URL does not work with HTTPS and browsers auto-upgrade to HTTPS.

This is not to be confused with the BitBadges API / Indexer API. This is the blockchain node's REST API.&#x20;
