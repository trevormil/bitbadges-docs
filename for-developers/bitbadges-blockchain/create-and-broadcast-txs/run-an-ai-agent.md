# Run an AI Agent

{% @github-files/github-code-block url="https://github.com/BitBadges/bitbadges-ai" %}

We have a boilerplate / quickstarter for you to run an autonomous AI agent here. Please read the README for all details.

This implements all of the signing functionality for a managed Ethereum address (the agent's address). You may also use this as a reference implementation.&#x20;
