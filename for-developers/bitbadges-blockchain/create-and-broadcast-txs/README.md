# Create, Generate, and Sign Txs

There are multiple ways you can create, generate, and sign transactions.&#x20;

-   CLI: Directly interact with the blockchain node's CLI in a terminal
-   Directly via Cosmos SDK practices like Keplr signing
-   Via our SDK

We recommend generating, signing, and broadcasting your transactions with the [BitBadges SDK](../../bitbadges-sdk/). The SDK provides easy-to-use TypeScript functions to construct transactions of all types and broadcast them to a blockchain node.
