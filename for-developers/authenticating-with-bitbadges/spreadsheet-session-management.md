# Extending with Zapier

**What is Zapier?**

Zapier is an online automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as Gmail, Slack, Mailchimp, and more than 2,000 others. You can automate repetitive tasks with workflows known as Zaps. A Zap connects two or more apps to automate part of your business or personal tasks. A Zap is created using a trigger and one or more actions. A trigger is an event in an app that starts the Zap. After a trigger occurs, Zapier automatically completes an action—or series of actions—in another app. This seamless connection between apps enables complex tasks to be completed automatically, saving time and improving productivity.

**How does Zapier fit in with Sign In with BitBadges?**

Zapier's integration capabilities can significantly enhance the functionality and user experience of applications utilizing Sign In with BitBadges. By connecting BitBadges with Zapier, developers can automate various processes, such as:

* **Access Management:** Automate the provisioning or deprovisioning of user access to other connected services based on their BitBadge credentials. For instance, granting access to a private repository on GitHub or a restricted channel on Discord when a user signs in with a specific BitBadge.
* **Event Logging:** Connect BitBadges to logging or analytics platforms, such as Google Sheets, to automatically track user sign-ins or other significant events, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

Integrating Zapier with Sign In with BitBadges opens up a world of possibilities for automating tasks, enhancing user engagement, and streamlining operations by leveraging the wide array of apps available in Zapier's ecosystem.

## **How to integrate with Zapier?**

Integrating Sign In with BitBadges with Zapier involves several steps designed to create a seamless connection between BitBadges' authentication service and the multitude of applications within Zapier's vast ecosystem. Follow these steps for integration:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your BitBadges Integration

Ensure you have a functioning Sign In with BitBadges setup for your application. This involves having your application registered, having access to BitBadges API credentials, and having a way to fetch the authentication details for your users (typically a callback handler).

#### Step 2: Create a Zapier Account

If you haven't already, sign up for a Zapier account at [Zapier](https://zapier.com). Consider planning your automation and the apps you intend to connect.

#### Step 3: Make a New Zap

A "Zap" is an automated workflow in Zapier. Create a new Zap and search for the Webhooks by Zapier integration. This will serve as the trigger.

#### Step 4: Configure the Trigger

Set up the Webhook to listen for a specific event from your BitBadges implementation, such as a successful sign-in.

You can customize what data is passed to this webhook. It is typically recommended to not pass sensitive information (signatures, etc) as these will be known by Zapier. Only pass the minimum data needed.

#### Step 5: Connect to Your Desired App

After setting up the trigger, you can select the action step to connect to your desired app (e.g., GitHub, Discord, Slack) and specify the action you want to perform, like granting access or sending notifications.

#### Step 6: Test and Activate

Always test your Zap to ensure it works as expected. After successful testing, activate your Zap to automate the workflow based on BitBadges sign-ins.

By following these steps, developers can harness the power of automation to enhance the functionality of Sign In with BitBadges, making it a more powerful tool for user authentication and access management.
