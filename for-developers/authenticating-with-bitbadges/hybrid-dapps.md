# What If I Need Wallets On App Side?

Sign In with BitBadges is unique because it allows you to build hybrid dApps, as we term them. Hybrid dApps outsource ALL of the wallet connection, signing, authentication to us. You have no need to implement anything wallet-related on your app side.

However, if your app already uses wallets, you can still use SIWBB.  The flow is the exact same, and as the user navigates to the SIWBB page, the user's wallet should auto-connect, resulting in a seamless experience. SIWBB can still be useful and provide authentication, a consistent claim interface, or be used to receive private attestations.&#x20;

Note: If you do have wallets and implement authentication on your end, SIWBB may be overkill as there are alternatives like using claim directly or checking other criteria behind the scenes without this step.&#x20;
