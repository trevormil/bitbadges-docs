# Hybrid dApps

Sign In with BitBadges is unique because it allows you to build hybrid dApps, as we term them. Hybrid dApps outsource ALL of the wallet connection, signing, authentication to us. You just use the resulting address as the username, and you have no need to implement anything wallet-related on your app side. As you see below, our quickstarter has a select for in-site wallets or not on your app side.

That is not to say that Sign In with BitBadges cannot be used with apps that support in-site wallets. The flow is the exact same, and as the user navigates to the SIWBB page, the wallet should hopefully auto-connect, resulting in a seamless experience.

Note: If you implement authentication on your side as well, SIWBB may be overkill as you can just use a claim directly or check other criteria behind the scenes.
