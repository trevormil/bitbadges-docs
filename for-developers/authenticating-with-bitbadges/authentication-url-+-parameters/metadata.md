# Metadata

```typescript
const popupParams = {
    ...,
    name: 'Event',
    description: 'Grants access to the event',
    image: 'ipfs://...'
}
```

**name**, **description**, and **image** follow the base metadata format. These will only be used for UI purposes and displaying everything nicely to the user. They are not included anywhere in the message.
