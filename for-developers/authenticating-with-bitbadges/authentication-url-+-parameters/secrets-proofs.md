# Secrets Proofs

**expectSecretsProofs** will tell us whether you expect the user to provide additional proof of credentials (i.e. saved secrets in their BitBadges account) to be verified. **onlyProofs** means you do not even expect a signature to be presented (only using the UI for obtaining proofs). See [here](https://docs.bitbadges.io/for-developers/core-concepts/verifiable-secrets) for verifying proofs.
