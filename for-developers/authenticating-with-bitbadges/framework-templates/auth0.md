# Auth0

**Social Connection Integration**

When adding a Social Connection, you will see BitBadges as a preconfigured option. This has everything setup for you. You will simply need to specify your client ID and client secret. You will also have to configure your redirect URI to match your Auth0 application's domain (for example, [https://dev-pgv803tz4ztg35oi.us.auth0.com/login/callback](https://dev-pgv803tz4ztg35oi.us.auth0.com/login/callback)).

Out of the box, this does not have support for any custom features like ownership requirements, attestations, etc. For that, you will need to create a custom connection with those parameters hardcoded in the URLs where needed.

**Custom Connections**

You can also customize the connection further by creating a custom connection. This allows you to add parameters beyond the standard flow.
