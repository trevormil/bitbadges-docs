# Blockchain Node API

Blockchain Node API - [https://lcd.bitbadges.io/](https://lcd.bitbadges.io/)\
\
Each blockchain node also has its own REST API that you can interact with via the endpoint above.&#x20;

Note this is different from the "BitBadges API". There is plenty of overlap, but our API indexes the blockchain, includes all off-chain items like claims, and more, If all you need is a simple getter for current blockchain state, then consider just running a node directly or using the blockchain's REST API.
