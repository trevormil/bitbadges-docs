3. This will take you to the billing page. Select your desired tier. Note that if you have a coupon code, it will probably only apply to a specific tier.

4. Lastly, complete the form, selecting your newly created API key. Enter your email, enter promo code (if applicable), and complete the rest of the form.

5. Once that form is submitted, you should be good to go to start building! See https://docs.bitbadges.io for more information on how to use the BitBadges API. The new tier may take 5-10 minutes to register, so please give it a little time.
