Many of your favorite frameworks already support Auth0, and you can simply use Sign In with BitBadges through that.

* Auth.js (Next Auth) - [https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/auth0](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/auth0)
* Amazon Cognito - [https://auth0.com/docs/customize/integrations/aws/amazon-cognito#configure-amazon-web-services](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/integrations/aws/amazon-cognito#configure-amazon-web-services)
* Supabase - [https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/auth0](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/auth0)

If you have any suggestions for unsupported integrations as well, let us know! And again, note that you are not locked into Sign In with BitBadges. You can use any Web3 authentication provider and then check BitBadges claim successes to gate anything.
