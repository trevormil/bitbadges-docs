**Can't find what you are looking for?**

Although we try to provide in-depth tutorials and examples in this documentation, we may have not covered everything, or some things may be confusing. Feel free to check out the source code directly at [https://github.com/bitbadges](https://github.com/bitbadges).&#x20;

If you do come across something not in the docs, it would be greatly appreciated if you could contact us to get it added or create a tutorial!

**Tutorials**

In the subpages of this section, we plan to host a comprehensive knowledge base of tutorials for BitBadges.

Reach out if you have a tutorial that you would like to add to this list!

Also, note that if what you are trying to do is related to Cosmos SDK or CosmWASM and not BitBadges specific, there may be tools/tutorials elsewhere such as:
