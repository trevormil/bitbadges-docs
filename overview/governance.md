# üè´ Governance

While in betanet, we will not propose any governance decisions. This is because in betanet, we want to ship fast and improve our product. Also, $BADGE allocations on betanet are for testing purposes only.

Once mainnet launches, we will allow token holders of $BADGE to vote on governance proposals, weighted via their amount of $BADGE. This will be via the [Cosmos SDK governance module](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/gov).
