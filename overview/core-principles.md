# ðŸ’¡ Core Principles

## Core Ideas

What are the core ideas and principles behind BitBadges?

* **Rapidly-Evolving**:  Create a single, dynamic token standard that rapidly evolves and improves over time.
  * Token standards should be flexible and continuously adding new functionality, as opposed to existing ones which are rigid, not adaptable, and hard to adopt new ones.
* **Cross-Chain**: Tokens should support users from ANY blockchain
* **Option of Decentralization:** Users should always have an option to interact with BitBadges in a trustless, decentralized manner. However, but we recognize that >90% of users don't care about decentralization.&#x20;
  * We offer functionality that sacrifices decentralization for user experience and scalability, but the option for full decentralization and trustless interaction will always be there.
* **User-Friendly**: Prioritize user experience over everything else.&#x20;
  * Users should not even need to know what a blockchain is or that they are using a blockchain. It should be as simple as browsing a typical website.
* **Community-Driven Ecosystem:** Make developing within the BitBadges ecosystem as easy as possible.
  * Long term, the goal is to have an ecosystem of thousands of community-built projects and tools for interacting with BitBadges.
* **Generic:** Design everything in a generic way that supports universality
* **Open-Source:** All code that makes BitBadges work will be open-sourced for public review
