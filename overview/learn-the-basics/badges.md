# Badges

Badges are on-chain, public tokens ownable and transferable by users from different addresses. These are handled on our own L1 blockchain and show up in your portfolio.&#x20;

Badges offer many never-seen-before-features and ways of implementation like time-dependent balances, off-chain hybrid balances, and much more. Badge distribution can be gated by claims, allowing you to offer minting / approvals gated by any criteria imaginable. On the flip side, use ownership as criteria to gate any service imaginable.
