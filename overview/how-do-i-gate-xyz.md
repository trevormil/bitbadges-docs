# üîê How Do I Gate...?

BitBadges provides flexible ways to gate (restrict access to) various types of content and utilities. Explore the claim builder and the rest of this documentation for more information.

Even if you create a badge, list, or other item, you will eventually create a badge-gated claim (separate), for example, to gate your app or service.

{% content-ref url="claim-builder/" %}
[claim-builder](claim-builder/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Gating a URL / Content

The simplest way to gate a static URL or content is to use BitBadges' built-in URL gating feature. This can be found in the rewards tab when creating a claim. Users will need to successfully complete the claim process to view the URL. This is perfect for:

* Private Discord invites
* Google Doc/Drive links
* File downloads
* Software downloads
* Exclusive website access
* Event registration links
* And more!

**Pro Tip**: For additional security, consider using one-time-use URLs, dynamic variables, or implementing additional verification on your destination website. The gated URL can also be a Sign In with BitBadges URL with eventual redirect to your service to provide seamless authentication.

## Gating a Discord, Telegram, Slack Channel

You can also configure your claim to auto implement utility for you with no-code. For example, assign a Discord role to users who successfully claim. This is a powerful tool because then you can create gated channels and offer further gated experiences however you see fit!

## Trigger a Zapier Zap -> 7000 No-Code Integrations

Configure your claim to send a post-success webhook to a Zapier Zap. This allows you to implement rewards from over 7000+ apps in no-code. This is great for services like newsletters, custom services, and much more! If you need a more programmatic solution, you can collect this same data via [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/bitbadges/integrations).

## Custom Forms, Webhooks, Plugins

Use the Forms plugin, custom webhooks, and custom plugins to collect user inputs (including attestations), social identifiers, and more. This allows you to maintain or create a list of users who you want to offer your gated utility too (e.g. send invites to the emails you collect).
