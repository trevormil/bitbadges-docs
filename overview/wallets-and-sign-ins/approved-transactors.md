# Approved Transactors

**Approved Transactors**

In your account settings, BitBadges provides the option to approve other wallets to transact on-chain your behalf. Note this is different from the alternate sign ins on the prior page which approve other ways to access your BitBadges account (off-chain). This feature can be used to configure hot wallets, for example, that are easier to access and can sign on your behalf.

Note: This feature is opt-in and not enabled by default.

**BitBadges Embedded Wallet**

You can approve any address / wallet, including the embedded wallet maintained by BitBadges. We will sign transactions / messages when requested, but the requester has to be signed in to BitBadges with the Embedded Wallet scope enabled. This feature is useful if you want to transact without needing access to your main wallet and/or to improve the experience without needing additional clicks to sign. You can setup alternate sign in methods that have the embedded wallet scope enabled.

Note: The embedded wallet is its own address and needs to.be treated as such. It needs to be registered, have sufficient funds, etc.

To sign transactions:

1. You must be signed in to the BitBadges account of the main wallet with permission to use the embedded wallet (the Embedded Wallet scope). You can configure alternate sign in methods (socials or other addresses) via the Sign In Methods tab. Ensure the Embedded Wallet              scope is enabled.
2. The desired transaction message types must be approved in the account settings before transacting.
3. The wallet must have sufficient $BADGE credits.

Note this is opt-in and can be revoked at any time. This is provided as a way to trade off centralization / trust for enhanced user experience but is completely optional. Also note that the BitBadges embedded wallet is not the only option. We provide the functionality for you to approve any wallet.
