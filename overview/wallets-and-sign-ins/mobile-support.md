# ðŸ“± Alternate Sign Ins / Mobile

Mobile support is a bit tricky since many wallets are geared towards desktop usage. If you want access to your BitBadges account on the go, consider adding approved sign-in methods in your account settings.&#x20;

This allows you to access certain aspects of your account via Signing In with Discord, Google, etc, or an alternate wallet. Use at your own risk though as approving socials means account compromise on your socials -. account compromise on BitBadges. Only assign the scopes that you need.

**Mobile App (PWA)**

While we do not have an official app on any app store, our web app is mobile friendly. It is also built as a PWA (progressive web app) which allows you to add it to your homescreen.&#x20;

Also, if you are using a mobile crypto wallet, please use best practices for that wallet. Some may require you to use their in-app browser, for example.
