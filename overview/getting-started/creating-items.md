# Creating Items

BitBadges is proud to offer no-code / low-code flows for all our major services. Simply navigate to the Create tab in-site, and get started creating badges, attestations, claims, address lists, explore listings, applications, and more!&#x20;

If you do need more advanced functionality or are confused at any part, we refer you to the respective parts of this documentation for more information. The developer documentation can help you implement more custom applications and flows.

Please reach out in Discord if you are having trouble, have feedback, or have feature requests!

If you just want to test out creating claims, see the Claim Tester. This allows you to create claims that will auto-delete when you are done.
