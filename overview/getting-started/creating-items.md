# Creating

BitBadges is proud to offer no-code / low-code flows for all our major services. Simply navigate to the Create tab in-site, and get started creating badges, attestations, claims, address lists, explore listings, applications, and more!&#x20;

If you do need more advanced functionality or are confused at any part, we refer you to the respective parts of this documentation for more information. The developer documentation can help you implement more custom applications and flows.

Please reach out in Discord if you are having trouble, have feedback, or have feature requests!

If you just want to test out creating claims, see the Claim Tester. This allows you to create claims that will auto-delete when you are done.

Claims are the backbone of almost everything else on the site. They can be used with badges or address lists to gate distribution. They can be standalone to gate custom utility. They can be combined with Sign In with BItBadges to create your own custom apps!

BitBadges claims allow you to check any criteria you want and offer your own custom utility to those who meet that criteria. In some cases, that may be other in-site services (points, badge distribution, etc). In other cases, you may have custom content you want to gate like URLs.&#x20;

There is plenty of customization in the design process. The easiest way though is to add a secret URL in the rewards tab which is gated to successful claimees.

Test it out with the Claim Tester in the developer portal.
