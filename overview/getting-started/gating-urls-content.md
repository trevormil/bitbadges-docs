# Gating URLs / Content

BitBadges offers gating-as-a-service. So, if you have anything from URLs to content that you want to gate access to, this is where BitBadges provides value! The easiest way to create a gated experience is to use BitBadges claims.&#x20;

BitBadges claims allow you to check any criteria you want and offer your own custom utility to those who meet that criteria. In some cases, that may be other in-site services (points, badge distribution, etc). In other cases, you may have custom content you want to gate like URLs.&#x20;

There is plenty of customization in the design process. The easiest way though is to add a secret URL in the rewards tab which is gated to successful claimees.

Test it out with the Claim Tester in the developer portal.
