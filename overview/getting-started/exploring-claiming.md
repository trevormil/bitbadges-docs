# Exploring

With regards to the user experience, everything is offered in-site as well from claims to transferring badges to anything we offer. We'd recommend to get started on the Browse / Explore tab or search an address, badge, anything with the top search bar.

If you have questions about a specific item, the specific page for that item should walk you through the entire process. Note that each creator may implement some of their logic in a different way (custom instructions, external flows).  The creator / provider will provide you with instructions if the flow is non-standard.
