# ðŸ“± Alternate Sign Ins / Mobile

### Mobile Support

Mobile support is a bit tricky since many wallets are geared towards desktop usage. If you want access to your BitBadges account on the go without access to your crypto wallet (needed for signing in), consider adding approved sign-in methods in your account settings. This allows you to access certain aspects of your account via Signing In with Discord, Google, etc.

**Mobile App (PWA)**

While we do not have an official app on any app store, our web app is mobile friendly. It is also built as a PWA (progressive web app) which allows you to add it to your homescreen, as seen below.

If you are using a mobile crypto wallet, please use best practices for that wallet. Some may require you to use their in-app browser, for example.

### Embedded Wallets

Each BitBadges account has an embedded wallet that is managed by BitBadges that can be used to transact on the blockchain on behalf of the main account.  This feature is useful if you want to transact without needing access to your main wallet and/or to improve the experience without needing additional clicks to sign.

To sign transactions:

1. You must be signed in to the BitBadges account of the main wallet with permission to use the embedded wallet (the Embedded Wallet scope). You can configure alternate sign in methods (socials or other addresses) via the Sign In Methods tab. Ensure the Embedded Wallet              scope is enabled.
2. The desired transaction message types must be approved in the account settings before transacting.
3. The wallet must have sufficient $BADGE credits.

Note this is opt-in and can be revoked at any time. This is provided as a way to trade off centralization / trust for enhanced user experience but is completely optional.

Also note that the BitBadges embedded wallet is not the only option. We provide the functionality for you to approve any wallet.
