# ðŸ“± Mobile Support

While we do not have an official app on any app store, our web app is built as a PWA (progressive web app) which allows you to add it to your homescreen, as seen below.

If you are using a mobile crypto wallet, please use best practices for that wallet. Some may require you to use their in-app browser, for example.
