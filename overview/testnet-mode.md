# ðŸ§ª Testnet Mode

Testnet mode provides a separate environment for testing purposes. It is isolated from the production environment and uses its own resources, such as a testnet blockchain, database, and more.

### Important Notes

You should treat testnet as an entirely SEPARATE service. NOTHING will carry over from normal mode (not even profiles, badges, settings, anything). This means it may or may not be the solution for you.

### Differences

* Some features available in production may not be accessible in testnet:
  * Social Sign Ins&#x20;
  * Balances are not hosted to the p
  * Buying $BADGE credits
  * Push notifications
  * And more
* Some restrictions may be more relaxed
  * No API keys required
  * Faucet may be more lenient
* Performance also may differ from the production environment
