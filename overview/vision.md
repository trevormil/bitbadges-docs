# ðŸ‘€ Vision

#### **Social Identity and Reputation**

BitBadges aims to help users establish their social identity on the internet through the use of blockchain technology and issuing badges. A user's portfolio of badges should be synonymous with their reputation. By viewing one's portfolio, you should be able to learn their reputation.

For example, you can browse a user's portfolio and see their positive achievements (e.g. certifications, etc), but you can also see the negative side (e.g. known scammer badge, rug pull, etc).

#### **Developer Ecosystem**

We envision thousands of projects being built upon BitBadges for unique use cases (i.e. tools, frontends, etc) that all use the BitBadges blockchain.

For example, one can create a niche frontend that only displays athletic achievement badges. This frontend may use the BitBadges blockchain and the API, but the frontend experience will be tailored towards an audience of athletes only.

#### **Peer-to-Peer Creator Economy**

We want to give a platform to creators and individuals that allows them to go peer to peer with any service they wish to offer via badges (e.g. gated content, ticketing services, etc).
