# ðŸ“– Address Surveys

A common problem is that a provider will not know their customers' blockchain addresses. BitBadges does offer non-address based solutions (like codes or passwords), but these may not be applicable to certain use cases.

We have created a little helper tool on the BitBadges website to streamline the process of collecting your users' addresses usernames. To create a survey, follow the instructions below:

1. Go to the Mint tab and create an address list. When prompted, selected Survey Mode.
2. Use the tools on the Actions tab to help you generate a survey URL to give out to users.
