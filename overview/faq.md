**Badge vs $BADGE?**

Whenever we say $BADGE, we are referring to the BitBadges blockchain token used for paying transaction fees and staking. This is not to be confused with badges / badge collections.

**Why is there a need for BitBadges?**

Over the past couple years, digital collectibles have taken the crypto industry by storm. We have all seen the mania (e.g. buying digital rock JPEGs for $1.3 million). You also may have heard that digital blockchain tokens have been touted to revolutionize almost any sector you can think of.

However, the BitBadges team noticed that the current solutions are not sufficient for these revolutions can take place. The current solutions only offer simple buy / sell / transfer functionality for tokens on a specific blockchain. BitBadges wants to help blockchain tokens realize their potential by building the necessary infrastructure!

#### What makes BitBadges better than competitors?

BitBadges has many advantages over competitors.

Firstly, BitBadges offers many more features than competitors (cross-chain, more customization options).&#x20;

Secondly, BitBadges offers a much more decentralized product than competitors. Everything is open-source, and there is no trusted third party involved in badge creation. With competitors, a centralized issuer must issue badges.

Lastly, our solution is more efficient and more scalable.

**Is BitBadges an L1 or an L2?**

BitBadges is its own Layer-1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK.&#x20;

**Are badges ERC-721 compatible?**

While our token standard takes inspiration from existing standards like ERC-721, our token standard is its own and has its own properties. Our base metadata standard (what is used on the BitBadges website) does extend the ERC-721 metadata standard, so metadata will be compatible.

**What happens if there is convergence to a single blockchain?**

Personally, we believe it will always be a multi-chain world, and there will never be 100% EVM convergence. Even if one blockchain ecosystem like Ethereum (EVM) is dominant, there will always be new blockchain experiments and L1s popping up. Thus, we believe there will always be a need for cross-chain infrastructure like BitBadges.&#x20;

If we are wrong and 100% convergence happens, BitBadges' cross-chain functionality will not be necessary, but this does not affect any of our other tools or infrastructure.
