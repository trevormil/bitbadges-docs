**Badge vs $BADGE?**

Whenever we say $BADGE, we are referring to the BitBadges blockchain token used for paying transaction fees and staking. This is not to be confused with badges / badge collections.

**Why is there a need for BitBadges?**

The answer is simple. We believe in the potential of digital blockchain tokens, but this potential cannot be realized with the current infrastructure and technology today. BitBadges wants to help blockchain tokens realize their potential by building this infrastructure!

#### What makes BitBadges better than competitors?

See [here](../#improvements-over-existing-standards).

**Is BitBadges an L1 blockchain or an L2?**

BitBadges is its own Layer-1 blockchain built with Cosmos SDK.&#x20;

**Are badges ERC-721 compatible?**

While our token standard takes inspiration from existing standards like ERC-721, our token standard has its own properties and architecture.

Our metadata standard (what is used on the BitBadges website) does extend the ERC-721 metadata standard, so metadata will be compatible.

**What happens if there is convergence to a single blockchain?**

Personally, we believe it will always be a multi-chain world, and there will never be 100% EVM convergence. Even if one blockchain ecosystem like Ethereum (EVM) is dominant, there will always be new blockchain experiments and L1s popping up. Thus, we believe there will always be a need for cross-chain infrastructure like BitBadges.&#x20;
