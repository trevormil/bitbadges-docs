# üèÖ Creating a Badge

### **How to create a badge?**

**Option 1 (Recommended): BitBadges Website**

The easiest and simplest way to create a badge is by using the Mint tab on the [BitBadges website](https://bitbadges.io). This page will walk you through step-by-step and let you customize your badge however you would like! This process is quick and easy. It can be done by anyone, regardless of their technical experience.

After the badge is created, management and distribution of the badge is also quick and easy via the [BitBadges website](https://bitbadges.io).

**Option 2 (Technical): BitBadges SDK / API**

Badges can also be created programmatically via the [BitBadges SDK](broken-reference) and/or [BitBadges API](../indexer-api/api/). This does requires some technical experience (JavaScript and HTTP APIs), but it is not difficult if you have a basic understanding.

Option 1 should be used for the majority of cases. Option 2 is typically only needed when you are building your own tools, writing scripts, creating your own frontend, etc.&#x20;

### **Need additional functionality?**

BitBadges offers a lot of customizable functionality for badges, but we do recognize that we do not support all possible cases.&#x20;

Our goal is to continuously improve and expand upon our offered functionality over time, but in the meantime, if your badge requires some unsupported functionality, you have two options.

**Option 1 (Technical): CosmWASM**

The BitBadges blockchain supports [CosmWASM](https://cosmwasm.com/) smart contracts. You can create a smart contract to implement custom functionality for your badge. See the [tutorial here](../for-developers/tutorials/use-cosmwasm.md).

If you do choose this option, we would also greatly appreciate if you let us know about the missing functionality that you required, so we can try to add it natively! To contact us, see [here](team-contact-us.md).

**Option 2: Request It**

Request the functionality to the BitBadges team, and we will do our best to try and add it as as soon as possible. To contact us, see [here](team-contact-us.md).
