# Total Supplys

Each badge in a collection will have its own circulating supply. Fou can think of the "Mint" address having unlimited balances, and the circulating supply is determined by the approvals and permissions of transfers from minting set up by the collection manager.

Badges can be fungible, non-fungible, or anything in between. Each has its own supply. And with time-dependent balances, this supply may change over time automatically.

Badges cannot be "burned" once created. However, they can be transferred (if allowed) to addresses where no private key is known such as the Ethereum zero address.
