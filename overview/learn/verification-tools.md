# Sign In with BitBadges

Gate any service (digital or in-person) with Sign In with BitBadges. All chains, one interface.

Gate your digital services with an industry standard OAuth 2..0 multi-chain authentication. This approach is a multi-chain replacement to "Sign In with Google". Or, leverage the QR code feature to create QR codes for gating in-person events. QR codes are exportable to any preferred format (email, Apple Wallet), so you do not need wallets at authentication time.

Additionally, use along with checking a claim to allow you to gate based on any criteria you want:

-   Payment-gated website
-   Token-gated event
-   Any combination of gated access!

We also are compatible with many frameworks and tools like Discourse, WordPress, Auth0, and more!
