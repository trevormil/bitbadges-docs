# Alternate Sign Ins / Mobile

If you want access to your BitBadges account on the go, consider adding approved sign-in methods in your account settings.&#x20; This allows you to access certain aspects of your account via Signing In with Discord, Google, etc, or an alternate approved method. Use at your own risk though as approving socials means account compromise on your socials -> account compromise on BitBadges. Only assign the scopes that you need. This can approve any off-chain action. 

For approving on-chain transactors, see the approved transactors page.

**Mobile Wallets**

Any mobile wallet is also supported. If you are using a mobile crypto wallet, please use best practices for that wallet. Some may require you to use their in-app browser, for example.

**Mobile App (PWA)**

While we do not have an official app on any app store, our web app is mobile friendly. It is also built as a PWA (progressive web app) which allows you to add it to your homescreen.&#x20;
