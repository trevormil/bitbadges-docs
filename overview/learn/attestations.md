# Attestations

Attestations are private by default credentials (e.g. signature of a specific claim like "Bob earned this diploma"). They enable individuals to prove claims about themselves (such as qualifications, achievements, or attributes) in a secure, tamper-evident, and privacy-preserving manner to any verifier.

These can be stored in your BItBadges account (or sent to the recipients) and selectively disclosed to whoever needs to verify them through claims or Sign In with BitBadges. Attestations are off-chain by default, but you can always anchor or prove existence of the attestation on-chain.

Attestations may come in different forms with varying properties, such as:

* Standard Signatures: Sign messages with your connected wallet address
* BBS+: Supports selectively disclosing only a subset of the N messages in the attestation. For example, disclose you are 21 without revealing your name.
* URLs: Attestations can even be a link to a URL as long as the verifier can verify it
