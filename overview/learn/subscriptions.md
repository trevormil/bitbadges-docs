# Subscriptions

Subscriptions are an abstraction over the badge / NFT interface using the time-dependent balances feature. Each subscription is a time-dependent NFT owned by the user for a specific period of time. We enable recurring support through a tip system for bots to fulfill each charge period's requests. For example, if a subscription is 10 $BADGE credits / month, the user may pay 11, and the bot profits the 1 for fulfillment.&#x20;

Subscriptions follow specific rules and are a subset of the overall badge standard. Please only update subscriptions through compatible interfaces.
