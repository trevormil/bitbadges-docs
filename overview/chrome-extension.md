# ðŸ§© Chrome Extension

The BitBadges Chrome extension provides a quick preview of a user's badges and portfolio by scanning the addresses on the current webpage and recommending ones to view. This tool is useful for easily assessing a user's trustworthiness through their BitBadges portfolio while browsing websites. You can add custom requirements as seen below which check for ownership of a custom set of requirements that you want to check.

**Install Link: TODO**

**Settings Page:** [https://bitbadges.io/chrome-extension](https://bitbadges.io/chrome-extension)

**Note for Developers:** The auto-scan feature only works if you have the **full** address somewhere in the DOM. If you abbreviate addresses (0xabc...123), it cannot pick up on these. It will scan if you have it anywhere such as an **alt** prop.
