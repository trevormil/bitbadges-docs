BADGE has 3 primary purposes:

1. Gas / Transaction Fees
2. Proof of Stake - Validators bonding BADGE for the security of the network via staking. In addition to network fees, our 0.5% protocol fee goes to the community pool / validators which makes the protocol sustainable.
3. In-Site Currency - Although note that we will prioritize others like USDC and other more established ones for this

For current distributions, supply, and more, we refer you to our explorer: [https://explorer.bitbadges.io](https://explorer.bitbadges.io/).&#x20;

BADGE is listed on Osmosis at [https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/BADGE](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/BADGE) and compatible with other IBC-enabled services.

Excluding block rewards, the initial circulating supply of BADGE is 100M. We plan to distribute BADGE throughout chaosnet via the following methods:

* 20M already in the community pool
* 20M to bootstrap initial validators
* 20M core team
* 40M airdropped through incentivized programs, campaigns, and more. Stay tuned for more details.
