BADGE has 3 primary purposes:

1. Gas / Transaction Fees
2. Proof of Stake/ Governance - Validators bonding BADGE for the security of the network via staking.
3. In-Site Currency - Although note that we will prioritize others like USDC and other more established ones for in-site use.
4. 0.1% Taker Fees on all transactions go to community pool

### **Distribution**

For current distributions, supply, and more, we refer you to our explorer: [https://explorer.bitbadges.io](https://explorer.bitbadges.io/).

Relevant addresses for undistributed BADGE are:

* bb1kx9532ujful8vgg2dht6k544ax4k9qzsp0sany
* bb1akp5qudlhyp08m4k6826hn8mhqwmely6xvr7t2

BADGE is listed on Osmosis at [https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/BADGE](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets/BADGE) and compatible with other IBC-enabled services.

Excluding block rewards, the initial circulating supply of BADGE was 100M.&#x20;

### **Alternative Chain Deployments**

BitBadges plans to pursue deploying our standard on other chains. BADGE also does not apply here. BADGE is the gas / governance token for the BitBadges blockchain only. Although when exploring agreements for deploying on other chains, we will strongly consider BADGE holders in any licensing agreement.

### **Security Model**

We do recognize that without a sustainable revenue model going back to BADGE holders for the short term. This is typically not adequate financial value to secure a proof-of-stake network. This is why the quality of validators and allocations is very important for our blockchain.&#x20;

Couple notes on our approach to this:

* In the short term, BitBadges still controls a large amount of the supply (>50%+) and operates on a more centralized governance at the moment, simply due to the fact that we have almost enough voting power to make any proposal pass.
* BitBadges, at the time of writing this, currently has \~70 validators. Almost all are experienced in Cosmos and are validating other networks. The quality of validators is very high at the moment.&#x20;
* Moving forward, we will look to adopt a Know-Your-Validator approach as we see fit. We will decentralize through allocations to trusted validators.

In other words, treat BitBadges as much more of a proof of authority chain at the moment.
