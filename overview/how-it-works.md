# üèÜ How It Works

See the [For Developers](broken-reference) section for further technical explanations.

## Badge Collections

Collections are the core concept of BitBadges. A collection consists of one or more badges, where each badge is its own token and can have its own unique metadata (title, description, image, etc) and properties (supply).&#x20;

Ex: A university can create a collection where each badge corresponds to the completion of a course.

### **Customization**

How can badge collections be customized?

**Metadata -** Collections and each individual badge can have unique metadata (title, description, image, etc).

**Supply** - Different badges in a collection can have a different total supply (e.g. badge ID #1 may have a supply of x100 whereas badge ID #2 only has x1).&#x20;

**Transferability -** All badges in a collection will share the same transferability. You can make a badge transferable which means it can be sent between users. Or, you can make it non-transferable where it is locked to an account. Or, you can pick and choose which addresses can send / receive badges.

**Permissions -** All collections must specify a user to be its manager. The manager can be granted special privileges, if desired.&#x20;

These privileges include:

* Can the manager add badges to the collection?
* Can the manager update the transferability?
* Can the manager delete the collection?
* Can the role of the manager be transferred?
* Can the manager update the bytes field?
* Can the manager update the metadata?

Once a permission is turned off (disabled), it can **never** be turned back on.&#x20;

**Standard:** Each badge must define what standard it uses which allows you to customize how to interpret the details of the badge. For developers, see [standards](../for-developers/need-to-know/standards.md).

### Distributing Badges (Minting)

At its core, there are three categories of distribution methods for badges as seen below. &#x20;

* **First Come, First Serve** - No criteria. Anyone who wants a badge can receive it. Limit one claim per address.
* **Whitelist** - Only specific addresses can receive badges. Can be sent directly or claimed by the recipient. Some helper tools we support include:
  * TODO
* **Codes / Password** - Generate a password or unique codes that can be entered to redeem the badge. These can be distributed in many ways. Currently, we support distributing via
  * Email
  * QR Code
  * URL



One of the core ideas behind BitBadges is we want to decentralize the distribution process across hundreds or thousands of community-built distribution tools. See [this tutorial](../for-developers/tutorials/build-a-distribution-tool.md) if you would like to create and add a new tool to the BitBadges website.



We are looking to add more distribution methods in the future! Examples include:

* Distribute via Location
* Distribute via Twitter Spaces











#### Distributing vs Transferring

Distribution or minting badges refers to the process of the initial allocation of the badges. Transferring means that the badges have already been distributed and are changing ownership.

Note that a collection's transferability does not apply to the distribution process. If badges in a collection are non-transferable, the recipient of the minted badge will not be able to transfer it, but the initial distribution will not be blocked.
