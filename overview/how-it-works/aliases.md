# Aliases

Alias addresses are an address for a non-claimable account that can receive badges. They have a portfolio and can receive badges, but  they can never generate or submit transactions. Alias addresses are slightly longer than traditional addresses.&#x20;

Aliases are used in the cases where you want a collection, specific badge, or list to own a badge. For example, you might want to assign a trustworthy badge to a collection. To do this, you send the trustworthy badge to the alias address' portfolio.
