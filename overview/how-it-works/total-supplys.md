# Total Supplys

Each badge in a collection will have its own total supply. This is the current amount of badges in circulation. When initially created, they will be sent to a special "Mint" address. From there, they can be distributed to users.

**Fungible vs Non-Fungible vs Semi-Fungible**

You may have heard the terms fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Fungible means that there is only one badge in a collection with X supply. Non-fungible means that there is multiple badges in a collection, all with a supply of 1.

BitBadges doesn't categorize them by these names because we use a semi-fungible standard where each badge can have a custom supply.

**Creating Badges**

Badges can be created out of thin air by the manager of the collection. During the collection creation transaction, they can create as many badges as they want. After that, they can only create according to the permissions set.
