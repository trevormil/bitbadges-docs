# Total Supplys

Each badge in a collection will have its own circulating supply. For on-chain badges, you can think of the "Mint" address having unlimited balances. All circulating supply originates from a transfer from the Mint address. This can be restricted with the necessary approvals and permissions as desired.

For off-chain badges, this is up to how the balances are allocated by the manager.

### **Fungible vs Non-Fungible vs Semi-Fungible**

You may have heard the terms fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Fungible means that there is only one badge in a collection with X supply. Non-fungible means that there is multiple badges in a collection, all with a supply of 1.

BitBadges doesn't necessarily categorize them by these names because we use a semi-fungible standard where each badge ID can have its own custom supply.

### **Burning Badges**

Badges cannot be "burned" once created. However, they can be transferred (if allowed) to addresses where no private key is known such as the Ethereum zero address.
