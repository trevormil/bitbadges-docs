# Total Supplys

Each badge in a collection will have its own total supply. This is the current amount of badges in circulation. When initially created, they will be sent to a special "Mint" address. From there, they can be distributed to users.

### **Fungible vs Non-Fungible vs Semi-Fungible**

You may have heard the terms fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Fungible means that there is only one badge in a collection with X supply. Non-fungible means that there is multiple badges in a collection, all with a supply of 1.

BitBadges doesn't categorize them by these names because we use a semi-fungible standard where each badge can have a custom supply.

### **Creating Badges**

Badges can be created by the manager of the collection. During the initial collection creation transaction, an infinite amount of badges can be created. In following transactions, they can only create badges according to the permissions set by the collection.

The permissions can be customized to permit or forbid the creation of a certain amount of badges at certain times. If the creation of all badges is locked forever, the total supply is final.

### **Burning Badges**

Badges cannot be "burned" once created. However, they can be transferred to the addresses where no private key is known such as the Ethereum zero address.
