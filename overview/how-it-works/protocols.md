# Protocols

Protocols group user data for specific purposes, organizing and managing similar activities or goals across applications. The data is stored on-chain, allowing for a decentralized and transparent approach. This also enables protocols to be leveraged across multiple applications in a universal way.

#### Examples

1. **Preferences Protocol**
   * Set personal preferences once for use across multiple apps
   * E.g., Setting dark mode preference applies to all supporting apps
2. **BitBadges Follow Protocol**
   * Users create "follow badge collections"
   * Owning a follow badge indicates following that user
   * Customizable management (off-chain or on-chain storage)
   * Users control their own collections
