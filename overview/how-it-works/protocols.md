# Protocols

### What Are Protocols?

Protocols allow you to group certain data from different users for a specific purpose. Think of it as a way to organize and manage similar activities or goals.

#### Example: Preferences Protocol

A preferences protocol might allow you to set personal preferences that can be used across different applications. It's like setting up your preferences once and having all your apps respect those settings.

Imagine you prefer using apps in dark mode. With a Preferences Protocol, you can set this preference once, and any app that supports this protocol will automatically switch to dark mode for you.

#### Example: BitBadges Follow Protocol

The **BitBadges Follow Protocol** lets users create "follow badge collections." If you own a follow badge from someone's collection, it means you are following them.

Different users can customize how they manage their follow badges. Some might choose to store them off-chain (not on the blockchain), while others prefer the security and transparency of on-chain storage.

Each user has control over their collection, making management easier and more flexible.

### How Protocols Work

Protocols use a subset of the map interface (a way of organizing data). They work with specific types of messages and use unique keys for querying.

#### Example Setup

Users can set up their collections for different protocols. Hereâ€™s how it might look:

```json
jsonCopy code{
    "BitBadges Follow Protocol": 12, // Collection ID 12 is used for my follows
    "Experiences Protocol": 13       // Collection ID 13 is used for my experiences
}
```

This information is stored on-chain for reliability and accessibility.

### Genesis Conditions

Some protocols might have initial conditions (genesis conditions) that need to be met. These are handled by the app you use and not checked on-chain.

#### Examples of Genesis Conditions:

* The creator must always be the manager.
* The total supply is fixed at a certain amount.
* Balances must be stored on-chain.

### Ideas for New Protocols

#### Messaging Protocol

Create a protocol where each badge sent is a message. The message content can be included in the metadata or memo field.

#### Social Media Protocols

Create protocols for various social media actions like posts, likes, follows, and usernames. For instance, a post could own a like badge. Use the "No Balances Standard" for items where balances don't matter.
