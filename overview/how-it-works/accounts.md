#### **How is BitBadges able to support addresses from different blockchains?**

To enable interoperability between different blockchains, BitBadges is signature compatible with all of its supported chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos).

Signature compatibility means that users from any of the aforemenetioned blockchain ecosystems are able to sign BitBadges transactions and compatible with the wallets of each ecosystem. However, BitBadges is its own blockchain and cannot pull any data from any other blockchain. Everything is confined to the BitBadges blockchain.
