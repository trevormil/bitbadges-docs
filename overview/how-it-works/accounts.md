### **How is BitBadges able to support addresses from different blockchains?**

To enable interoperability between different blockchains, BitBadges is signature compatible with all of its supported chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos).

Signature compatibility means that users from any of the above blockchain ecosystems are able to sign BitBadges transactions. BitBadges is also compatible with the wallets of each ecosystem. However, BitBadges is its own blockchain and cannot pull any data from any other blockchain. Everything is confined to the BitBadges blockchain.

### **Why do I see multiple equivalent addresses?**

All addresses map to an equivalent one in a different ecosystem (see the image below). You may be used to seeing your address as an Ethereum address, but behind the scenes, your mapped Cosmos address may be used for record keeping.
