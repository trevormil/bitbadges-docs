#### **How is BitBadges able to support addresses from different blockchains?**

To enable interoperability between different blockchains, BitBadges is signature comaptible with all of the supported chains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos).&#x20;

Signature compatibility means that users from any of the aforemenetioned blockchain ecosystems are able to sign BitBadges transactions. BitBadges is also compatible with many of the wallets of each ecosystem. However, BitBadges is its own blockchain and does not pull any data from any other blockchain. Everything is confined to the BitBadges blockchain.
