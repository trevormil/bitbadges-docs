# Badges vs Lists

### Badges

Badges are blockchain tokens with customizable properties. They're more complex but offer greater flexibility than address lists.

#### Key Concepts

* Collections: Core units of BitBadges, identified by numeric IDs
* Badges: Individual tokens within collections, also with numeric IDs

#### Customization Options

1. [Collection Metadata](metadata.md): Name, description, image, category, etc.
2. [Badge Metadata](metadata.md): Individual badge details
3. [Supply](total-supplys.md): Total supply for each badge
4. [Balances Types](balances-types.md): On-chain or off-chain storage
5. [Transferability](transferability.md): Rules for badge transfers and distribution
6. [Manager](manager.md): Optional admin with customizable permissions
7. [Standard](standards.md): Defines how to interpret badge details
8. And more!

### Address Lists

Address lists are simpler, being a simple list of users identified by their addresses. They offer less complexity (no balance ownership, no transferability, etc.), but this comes at the cost of flexibility / customization. The list creator can manage the list, its rules, and who is on it.

### **Connecting to Claims**

The distribution process for badges or lists is highly customizable with BitBadges claims, depending on the creator's specific requirements and the type of collection or list they've created. To understand how a particular collection or list is distributed, you should visit the dedicated page for that collection.

Creators have a wide range of options for distributing badges and list spots, from manual distribution to automated claims integrated with thousands of applications. Each method has its own set of trade-offs and benefits.
