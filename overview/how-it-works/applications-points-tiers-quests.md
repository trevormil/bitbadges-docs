# Applications (Points, Tiers, Quests)

Using claims, you can offer points, tiers, and quests to users, and create gamified experiences directly in the site. Claims are the main entrypoint to these, so you get x10 points for satisfying claim criteria, for example.

Create an application that offters points, tiers, and/or quests all in one page in the developer portal.
