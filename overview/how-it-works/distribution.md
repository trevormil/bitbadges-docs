# Distribution / Collection

BitBadges operates on a multi-chain platform, enabling users from various blockchain ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos) to seamlessly send and receive badges across different networks.

For information on the advantages and disadvantages of different balance types (on-chain vs off-chain), please refer to our [balance types guide](balances-types.md).

## Distribution Methods

The distribution process for badges or lists is highly customizable, depending on the creator's specific requirements and the type of collection or list they've created. To understand how a particular collection or list is distributed, you should visit the dedicated page for that collection.

Creators have a wide range of options for distributing badges, from manual distribution to automated claims integrated with thousands of applications. Each method has its own set of trade-offs and benefits.

### Three Main Approaches to Gating Distribution / Collection

1. **Zapier Integration**

    - Trigger -> Complete Claim: Set up a Zapier trigger that initiates the claim process when certain conditions are met.
    - Complete Claim -> Post-action Trigger: Configure actions to occur after a successful claim, such as updating a database or sending a notification.

2. **In-site Community-driven Plugin Integrations**

    - Utilize pre-built integrations developed by the BitBadges community.
    - These plugins can connect your distribution process to popular platforms and services.

3. **Custom Integration via BitBadges API**
    - For advanced users or unique requirements, create a custom distribution system using the BitBadges API.
    - This option provides the most flexibility and control over the distribution process.

### Examples of Distribution Methods

-   **Passwords:** Implement a reusable password that users must enter to claim a badge.
-   **Unique Codes:** Generate one-time use codes for individual claims.
-   **Whitelists / Blacklists:** Restrict claims to specific addresses or exclude certain addresses from claiming.

## Collection / Claiming Process

The process of collecting badges or getting on a list can vary depending on the creator's setup. Here are the typical methods:

1. **BitBadges Site Claiming**

    - The most common method involves the creator providing a claim link.
    - Users visit the BitBadges site and complete a claim form to receive their badge or be added to a list.
    - This process may involve verifying information or meeting specific criteria set by the creator.

2. **Airdrops**

    - Creators can directly distribute badges to user addresses without requiring any action from the recipients.
    - This method is useful for rewarding existing community members or incentivizing participation.

3. **Custom Claim Flows**
    - Some creators may opt to create their own claim flows or integrate the claiming process into their websites or applications.
    - These custom solutions still utilize the BitBadges API but offer a more tailored user experience.

### Notifications / Alerts

To keep users informed about available claims or successful distributions, creators can leverage claim alerts. These can be implemented in several ways:

-   **In-site Notifications:** Users receive alerts directly on the BitBadges platform.
-   **Existing Communication Channels:** Creators can use their established communication methods (e.g., email, Discord, Telegram) to notify users about claim opportunities or successful distributions.

**Important Note:** Always exercise caution when interacting with third-party claims or distribution methods. Verify the authenticity of the source before providing any information or connecting your wallet.
