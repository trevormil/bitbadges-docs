# BitBadges Claims

Claims are the backbone of pretty much all aspects of BitBadges. Combine criteria checks from 7000+ applications, plugins, and services to gate anything from content to websites to badge distribution and more. Claims offer flexible implementation methods from no-code, in-site plugins to custom webhooks to a no-code Zapier integration connecting you to 7000+ apps and more.&#x20;

Claims are simply thought of as: Meet criteria? You get this utility. The utility can be anything from website access to badge distribution to being added to a list. Its all up to you!

Let BitBadges do the heavy lifting, enabling you to focus on offering your core utility. &#x20;

**The Claiming Process**

Typically, the end user will claim directly on the BitBadges site, but you may also optionally auto-trigger claims for users via the API, Zapier, or however you choose to implement.&#x20;

**Creating a Claim**

Try creating one in the developer portal here directly on the BitBadges site! For more advanced information, we refer you to the Developers section of the docs.
