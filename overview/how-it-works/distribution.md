# Distribution / Collection

BitBadges is multi-chain meaning that any blockchain user from one ecosystem (e.g. Ethereum) can receive and send badges to and from users from another ecosystem (e.g. Cosmos).

See [here](balances-types.md) to learn about the pros and cons of the different balance types (on-chain vs off-chain).

## How is everything distributed?

Distributing depends on your unique requirements and the type of collection / list you have created. Typically, the creator sets up the rules for how everything is distributed. **To see how a specific collection / list is distributed, you must visit the page for that collection.**

The collection / list creator can determine how the badge is distributed. There are many options for such badges, ranging from manual distribution to setting up claims that integrate with over 7000+ apps. Distribution criteria is completely customization. All options have their own tradeoffs.

Some examples include

* **Passwords:** Set up a reusable password that must be entered to claim a badge.
* **Codes:** Generate unique one-time use only codes that allow users to claim.
* **Whitelists / Blacklists**: Only allow specific addresses to claim.

## How do you collect badges / get on a list?

Again, this is super open ended. The most common flow is the creator wil lgive you a claim link that takes you to the BitBadges site. But depending on the configuration, the creator can also auto-claim on your behalf.

**Always interact with third parties at your own risk!**

### **Notifications / Alerts**

Notification (or claim alerts) can be sent in-site, or you can use your preferred method of communicating with your users.
