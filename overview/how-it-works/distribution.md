# Distribution

Once the collection is created, the badges then have to be distributed to owners. BitBadges is cross-chain meaning that any blockchain user from one ecosystem (e.g. Ethereum) can receive and send badges to and from users from another ecosystem (e.g. Cosmos).

Distribution can be done via your preferred method. Some examples are via **password, QR codes, e-mails, whitelists, first-come first-serve, manually transfering to each recipient, etc.**&#x20;

If you do not intend to distribute manually but rather via a claim, you should answer the following questions:

1. **How am I identifying my recipients?**&#x20;
   1. If via their addresses, a whitelist is probably the best option.&#x20;
   2. If via some other method (email address, social media username, etc), it is probably best to generate unique codes / passwords and have users claim that way.
2. **How am I going to collect all my recipients' details?** You can collect details using any method you prefer. Some examples include:
   1. Paperform - Collect users information via an online survey form.
   2. Rafflecopter - Have users sign up for a raffle.
3. **How will I notify recipients / provide them the details?**&#x20;
   1. If you create a whitelist through the BitBadges app, it will automatically create a notification next time they log in to the app. No additional details (like codes or a password ) are needed for whitelists.
   2. For distributing codes / passwords and notifying users, this can be done via many services such as Mailchimp for ending codes via email or SMS, using social media to direct message your codes, etc.

See [Ecosystem ](../ecosystem.md)to find a list of all distribution tools built by the BitBadges team and community. See [this tutorial](../../for-developers/tutorials/build-a-distribution-tool.md) if you would like to create and add a new tool.
