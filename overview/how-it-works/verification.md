### Querying Badge Ownership

Querying badge ownership involves checking who owns badges at specific times. This process allows you to gather information about badge holders without necessarily verifying their claims.

In the context of BitBadges, querying badge ownership can be performed through the web app or various alternative methods such as running your own blockchain, using the BitBadges API, or utilizing community-built tools tailored to different use cases (websites, in-person events, etc). You can explore these tools in the [Ecosystem](../ecosystem/) section and choose the one that best suits your requirements.

### Verifying Badge Ownership

Once you create and distribute your badges, a big part of offering utility is verifying who owns your badges at specific times.&#x20;

**Important: Badge verification is a two-step process:**

* Querying badge ownership - Check that the user's address actually owns the badge on the BitBadges blockchain
* Verification of address ownership - Check that the user actually owns the address they are claiming

Please note that merely checking the BitBadges website ([https://bitbadges.io](https://bitbadges.io/)) without verifying the user's address ownership may not be sufficient, as users could potentially not own the address they say they own.

#### Verification of Badge Ownership

The verification of badge ownership involves confirming that a user's address genuinely possesses the badge on the BitBadges blockchain. This is the query step explained above.

#### Verification of Address Ownership

In addition to badge ownership verification, it's crucial to verify the ownership of the claimed address itself. This step ensures that the user actually possesses the address they are asserting. This can again be achieved through ecosystem verification tools.

We recommend using Blockin to perform this step. The QR codes feature on the web app uses Blockin to help you verify addressees and badge ownership in-person.&#x20;
