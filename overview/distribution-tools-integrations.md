# ðŸ”€ Distribution Tools

There are infinitely many ways to distribute badges to holders. On the BItBadges site, we natively support the building blocks (whitelists, passwords, claim codes, QR codes). However, these are to be combined with distribution tools to further enhance the distribution experience. For example, you might create a code-based claim on the BitBadges website but distribute the codes in a variety of ways such as via email, Discord, or SMS.

BitBadges aims to have a vast ecosystem of community-built distribution tools. Our goal is that users will have thousands of options to choose from built by different teams, each offering their own unique niche.

Here, we provide documentation for common distribution integrations / tools as a reference. Let us know if you want to add a tool or tutorial here. **Always use third party tools at your own risk!** You know your users best. The best method is the way you typical communicate with users.

Distribution may involve:

* Collecting addresses or usernames of your users to implement whitelists
* Distributing codes / passwords that are used to claim badges
* Notifying users they are on an whitelist
* Notifying users for how to earn / collect this badge

### Address Surveys

* BitBadges - Create an address list with the Create tab and set Survey Mode to true. This will create a list, and users can add addresses to the survey given a unique link. For more customization, see the developer documentation [here](../for-developers/tutorials/custom-address-surveys.md).

### Email

* Email Helper Tool - [https://bitbadges-email-distribution-tool-trevormil.vercel.app/](https://bitbadges-email-distribution-tool-trevormil.vercel.app/) ([Code](https://github.com/BitBadges/bitbadges-email-distribution-tool))
* Mailchimp - distribute codes / passwords via the use of merge tags

### SMS

* Twilio - Twilio is a popular platform for sending SMS messages programmatically. You can use Twilio's API to send unique codes or passwords via SMS to your users.

### Social Media

* Distribute codes / passwords or alert users of whitelist opportunities via social media communication (DMs, announcements, tweets, etc).

### Web2 Payments

* Stripe - Stripe is a reliable payment gateway that you can integrate into your distribution platform.
