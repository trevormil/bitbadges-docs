# ðŸ”¨ Getting Started

BitBadges is proud to offer no-code / low-code flows for all our major services. Simply navigate to the Create tab in-site, and get started creating badges, attestations, claims, address lists, explore listings, applications, and more! The site should walk you through the entire process, and refer to the documentation where needed. Please reach out in Discord if you are having trouble, have feedback, or have feature requests.

Claims are the universal connectors. Gate anything with any criteria. For example:

1. Create your badge and create badge-gated claims to implement badge-gated utility
2. Award points and create points-gated claims&#x20;
3. Or, just create standalone claims
