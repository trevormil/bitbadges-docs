# ðŸ”¨ Getting Started

BitBadges is proud to offer no-code / low-code flows for all our major services. Simply navigate to the Create tab in-site, and get started creating badges, attestations, claims, address lists, explore listings, applications, and more! The site should walk you through the entire process.&#x20;

In many cases, everything you want to do is already possible in-site! If you do need more advanced functionality or are confused at any part, we refer you to the respective parts of this documentation for more information. The developer documentation can help you implement more custom applications and flows.

Please reach out in Discord if you are having trouble, have feedback, or have feature requests!&#x20;
