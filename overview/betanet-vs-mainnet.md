# ðŸ•‘ Betanet vs Mainnet

In order to allow us to ship a great product and receive feedback, we will first launch a betanet version of BitBadges to test features and ship fast. Once we feel ready, we will launch an official mainnet.

Betanet has currently started.

Mainnet start date is TBD.

## Betanet vs Mainnet

For both betanet and mainnet, we will focus on badges only (i.e. tokens with no value) and leave valuable tokens (digital collectibles) to users' respective ecosystems. Our L1 token, $BADGE, will only be allowed to be used for gas fees.

### Betanet

This test period will be indefinite and subsidized to users at no cost. As an incentive, betanet users, testers, and validators will receive a greater allocation of airdrop tokens ($BADGE) when we launch the mainnet. Moreover, we will provide users with the option to migrate anything they have on the betanet over to the mainnet, free of charge.

The betanet chain will become a testnet, upon mainnet launch.

### Mainnet

Tokenomics and airdrop allocations TBD.
