# ðŸ•‘ Betanet vs Mainnet

Our first and foremost goal is to focus on shipping a great product. To do this, we will first launch a betanet version of BitBadges to test features and ship fast. Once we are ready, we will launch an official mainnet. After that, we will see what's next based on user feedback.

## Betanet vs Mainnet

For both betanet and mainnet, we will focus on badges only (i.e. tokens with no value) and leave valuable tokens (digital collectibles) to users' respective L1s.  Our L1 token, $BADGE, will only be allowed to be used for gas fees. This is to focus on shipping a great product for our users and not rushing anything.&#x20;

### Betanet

To ensure the optimal functionality and receive valuable feedback, we will begin by launching a beta version of everything, called betanet. This test period will be indefinite and provided to users at no cost. Our goal during this period is to rapidly release and implement features quickly, as well as receive valuable user feedback.

As an incentive, betanet users and validators will receive a greater allocation of airdrop tokens ($BADGE) when we launch the mainnet. Moreover, we will provide users with the option to migrate anything they have on the betanet over to the mainnet, free of charge.

The betanet chain will become a testnet, upon mainnet launch.

### Mainnet

Once betanet has concluded, we will launch an official mainnet. &#x20;

Tokenomics and airdrop allocations TBD.
