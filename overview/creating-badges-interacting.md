# üèÖ Creating Badges / Interacting

### **How to interact with BitBadges (create collections, browse, transfer, etc)?**

**Option 1 (Recommended): BitBadges Website**

The easiest and simplest way to create a badge is by using the Mint tab on the [BitBadges website](https://bitbadges.io). This page will walk you through step-by-step and let you customize your badge! This process is streamlined for user experience, so it is quick and easy!&#x20;

The BitBadges website should be adequate for almost all users. However, note it is optimized for user experience, so we do sacrifice a little customizability. For more advanced customization, see Options 2 or 3.&#x20;

After the badge is created, management, distribution, and transfers of badges are also quick and easy via the [BitBadges website](https://bitbadges.io).

**Option 2: Ecosystem Tools**

Check out the [Ecosystem](ecosystem.md) to browse other tools and projects built by the community!

**Option 3 (Technical): BitBadges SDK / API**

Badges can also be created programmatically via the [BitBadges SDK](broken-reference) and/or [BitBadges API](../indexer-api/api.md). This requires some technical experience (JavaScript and HTTP APIs), but it also allows you to customize your badges even more.

Option 1 should be used for the majority of cases. Option 2 is typically only needed when you are building your own tools, need more customization,writing scripts, creating your own frontend, etc.&#x20;



### **Need additional functionality not supported?**

While BitBadges offers a wide range of customizable functionality for badges, we understand that not all cases are currently supported. We are committed to continuously improving and expanding our offered functionality over time. If you find that your use case requires unsupported functionality, you have two options:

**Option 1 (Technical): CosmWASM**&#x20;

The BitBadges blockchain supports [CosmWASM](https://cosmwasm.com/) smart contracts, which can be used to implement custom functionality for your badge. A tutorial is available [here](../for-developers/tutorials/create-a-smart-contract.md). We would appreciate it if you could inform us of any missing functionality from the interface you require when choosing this option, so we can try to add it natively. Please contact us [here](team-contact-us.md).

**Option 2: Request It**&#x20;

You can request the functionality from the BitBadges team, and we will do our best to add it as soon as possible. Please contact us [here](team-contact-us.md). Or, draft an improvement proposal [here](https://github.com/BitBadges/BBIPs).
