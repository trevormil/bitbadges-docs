# Gate a URL

To setup your claim, [see the previous tutorial](create-your-first-claim.md).

All you need to do to gate a URL is to add it as a gated reward in the rewards tab! This will make it only visible to those who successfully claim (or whatever criteria you set).

You can do this in the Rewards section when configuring the claim.
