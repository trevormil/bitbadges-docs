# Create Proof of Purchase Badge w/ Zapier

A cool application of badges is to create proof of authenticity badges for product purchases from storefronts like Shopify, BigCommerce, or Adobe Commerce. This tutorial will walk you through an example on how to do this with Zapier.&#x20;

1. Create a dynamic email store in the developer portal at [https://bitbadges.io/developer](https://bitbadges.io/developer).&#x20;

2. Create a Zapier Zap that adds the emails to the dynamic store upon new orders. Use the manage tab in the dynamic store interface to auto-create the template for you. Make sure you dynamically replace the customer email with the one entered into the dynamic store.

3. Create a badge at [https://bitbadges.io/create](https://bitbadges.io/create).
4. When you reach the claim select step, configure your claim to use the Email plugin to gate mints. For on-chain badges, this will be the Minting step. Then, select "Use Dynamic Store?" and select your store.

5. Create the badge! Users will now have to provide proof of purchase (checked via the email store) before they claim! Once they receive the badge on-chain, they have a verifiable on-chain proof of authenticity certificate that they can use when transferring ownership in the future.



**Step-by-Step Guide**

The claim will be part of the badge or list creation process or can be standalone if used for other purposes.
