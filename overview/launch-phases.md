# ðŸª™ Launch Phases

## **Phases**

BitBadges plans to execute a two-phased launch:

### **Phase 1: Betanet**&#x20;

Betanet is the initial phase of BitBadges upon launch. This is a phase where we plan to ship fast, gain feedback quickly, and iron out all bugs as quickly as possible in order to build the best product for you long term. To allow us to do so, there will be no governance decisions, and all in-app credits will be purchasable via a faucet-like system (explained below).

### **Phase 2: Mainnet**

Once betanet is concluded and we feel ready, we will officially deploy a mainnet version of BitBadges. Everything will carry over. In mainnet, we will look to decentralize further, operate under a governance model, and see out our vision as a fully decentralized and indestructible protocol. This will most likely be started when the betanet faucet runs out.

## **Credits ($BADGE vs $STAKE)**

$BADGE is the in-app compute credits system we use to maintain our infrastructure with, such as staking for nodes or creating badges. All important operations will require a fee of some number of credits.

$STAKE is the credits system used by nodes to secure the network (via proof-of-stake). Once mainnet launches, we also plan for these to be used in governance decisions.

IMPORTANT: $BADGE and $STAKE are NOT to be speculated upon. It is a system which is intended for purchase and usage as compute credits, not trading, exchanging, etc.

## **Tokenomics of $BADGE**

**Total Supply: 100,000,000**

**Inflation: None**

All $BADGE credits will be minted upon mainnet genesis (i.e. no inflation / deflation).&#x20;

**Initial Airdrop: 10,000,000**

Crtieria: TBD

To claim, go to the [BitBadges website](https://bitbadges.io), sign in, and navigate to a page which requires registration, such as the Create tab.

**Faucet: 90,000,000**

The rest of the supply is up for purchase via the BitBadges site. BitBadges reserves the right to dynamically increase / decrease according to demand.&#x20;

## **Tokenomics of $STAKE**

**Initial Supply: 100,000,000**

**Inflation: 7-20% (Set at 13%)**&#x20;

$STAKE will inflate at rate of 7-20% per year. Learn more about how this works [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/mint). This serves as an incentive for nodes to put their stake to work and secure the netowrk and earn more.

**Allocation**

Reach out to us in DIscord if you are interested in running a node. $STAKE will be distributed (while supplys last) for free to those who complete a quick application process. This is to ensure the quality of node operators in our ecosystem.
