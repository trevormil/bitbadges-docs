# ðŸª™ Launch Phases

BitBadges plans to execute a two-phased launch:

### **Phase 1: Betanet**&#x20;

Betanet is the initial phase of BitBadges upon launch. This is a phase where we plan to ship fast, gain feedback quickly, and iron out all bugs as quickly as possible in order to build the best product for you long term. To allow us to do so, there will be no governance decisions, and all in-app credits will be purchasable via a faucet-like system (explained below).

### **Phase 2: Mainnet**

Once betanet is concluded and we feel ready, we will officially deploy a mainnet version of BitBadges. Everything will carry over. In mainnet, we will look to decentralize further, operate under a governance model, and see out our vision as a fully decentralized and indestructible protocol. This will most likely be started when the betanet faucet runs out. At this time, we will also look to explore other means of $BADGE distribution and exchanging.

### **Tokenomics of $BADGE**

$BADGE is the in-app compute credits system we use to maintain our infrastructure with, such as staking for nodes or creating badges. All important operations will require a fee of some number of credits.

IMPORTANT: $BADGE is NOT to be speculated upon. It is a system which is intended for purchase and usage as cimpute credits, not trading, exchanging, etc.

**Total Supply: 100,000,000**

All $BADGE credits will be minted upon mainnet genesis (i.e. no inflation / deflation).&#x20;

**Initial Airdrop: 10,000,000**

Crtieria: TBD

To claim, go to the [BitBadges website](https://bitbadges.io), sign in, and navigate to a page which requires registration, such as the Create tab.

**Faucet: 90,000,000**

The rest of the supply is up for purchase via the BitBadges site. BitBadges reserves the right to dynamically increase / decrease according to demand.&#x20;
