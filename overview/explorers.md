# ðŸ“Š Explorers

We plan to get integrated on open source Cosmos explorers such as [https://ping.pub/](https://ping.pub/) or MintScan but currently are not.  For now, you may use [https://bitbadges.io](https://bitbadges.io) to browse badge activity and see your current $BADGE balance and other info.
