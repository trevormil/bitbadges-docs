# ðŸ’³ Supported Wallets

**Ethereum**

We use WalletConnect to support over 100 Ethereum wallets such as Metamask, Ledger, and many more (see full list [https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet](https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet)).

If you are on mobile, currently, all the above wallets are supported for browsing the BitBadges website, but submitting transactions will not be supported. We are working on fixing this.

MetaMask Mobile does work for everything, if you use the in-app browser.
