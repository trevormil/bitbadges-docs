# ðŸ’³ Supported Wallets

**Ethereum**

We use WalletConnect to support over 100 Ethereum wallets such as Metamask, Ledger, and many more (see full list [https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet](https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet)).

If you are using a mobile wallet with an in-wallet browser, please use that browser.



Note that we are working on ironing out the bugs for the support of many wallets. Let us know in Discord if your wallet is not connecting properly.
