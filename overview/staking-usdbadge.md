# ü§ù Staking $BADGE

The BitBadges blockchain is a [delegated proof-of-stake blockchain](https://101blockchains.com/proof-of-stake-vs-delegated-proof-of-stake/). Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a blockchain consensus mechanism where token holders elect a small group of trusted members (validators) to validate transactions and maintain the network. These validators stake their own $BADGE and earn additional $BADGE from maintaining the network.&#x20;

The delegated part is because token holders can delegate their stake ($BADGE) to validators and split the earned $BADGE, according to their delegation and commission charged by the validator. This enabes token holders to contribute to the security of the network without running their own validator.



Betanet validators and stakers will receive extra mainnet $BADGE upon launch via the airdrop.

### Option 1: Delegate

For most users, delegating is the preferred option. You can delegate your $BADGE to an existing validator to be staked. This validator will split the $BADGE earned from securing the network with you (they may charge a commission).&#x20;

Behind the scenes, this uses the [Cosmos SDK staking](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/staking) module.&#x20;

### **Option 2: Become a Validator**

If you want to become a validator and stake directly by running a validating node, see [here](../blockchain/run-a-node.md).&#x20;

To become a betanet validator, reach out to us to receive a sufficient amount of $BADGE to stake.
