# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» Contributing

Everything is open-sourced and can be found at [https://github.com/bitbadges](https://github.com/bitbadges). Contributions to the core source code are greatly appreciated.&#x20;

Additionally, you can contribute by building on top of BitBadges. This can be anything from a dApp (decentralized application) to a developer tool to your own frontend for badges! If you do, reach out to us, so we can add it to [Ecosystem](ecosystem.md).

**Rewarding Developers**

In the future, we plan to host hackathons, bug bounties, and setup a developer funding pool where developers are rewarded for contributing and building with BitBadges.

**Improvement Proposals**

The official BitBadges improvement proposals repository can be found at [https://github.com/BitBadges/BBIPs](https://github.com/BitBadges/BBIPs).&#x20;

**Bug Bounties**

TBD

**Bounties**

Below are some ideas for community tools that need to be built, and we are willing to provide compensation for.

**Discord Badge-Gating** - Gate servers, channels, etc to only specific badge holders

**Twitter Bot** - Bot that posts for every badge mint, transfer, etc

And more! Let us know if you have an idea.
