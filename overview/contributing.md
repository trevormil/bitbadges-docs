# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» Contributing

Everything is open-sourced and can be found at [https://github.com/bitbadges](https://github.com/bitbadges). Contributions to the core source code are greatly appreciated.&#x20;

Additionally, you can contribute by building on top of BitBadges. This can be anything from a dApp (decentralized application) to a developer tool to your own frontend for badges! If you do, reach out to us, so we can add it to [Ecosystem](ecosystem.md).

**Rewarding Developers**

In the future, we plan to host hackathons, bug bounties, and setup a developer funding pool where developers are rewarded for contributing and building with BitBadges.
