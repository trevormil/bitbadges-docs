# ü§ù BitBadges Follow Protocol

The BitBadges multi-chain follow protocol is an extension of the BitBadges platform, designed to enable users to follow one another across different blockchain networks. This protocol allows for seamless cross-chain following, allowing an Ethereum user to follow a Solana user and vice versa.

In this system, all follow actions are represented as unique badges stored on the blockchain. For instance, if you possess a follow badge created by a user named Bob, it signifies that Bob is following you. This approach abstracts the concept of following on the blockchain, making it interoperable across various blockchain ecosystems and providing users with a standardized way to establish and showcase their followers.

Furthermore, the BitBadges multi-chain follow protocol enhances user experience and scalability of follows by leveraging the unique hybrid balances feature of BitBadges. This innovative approach allows users to manage their follow badge balances off-chain, eliminating the need for constant on-chain interactions when following or unfollowing others. In fact, they can be facilitated off-chain in one click at no cost!
