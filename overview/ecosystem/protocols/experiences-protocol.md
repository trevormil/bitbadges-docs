# Experiences Protocol

The BitBadges Experience Protocol is a protocol where users can share their experiences, interactions, and opinions of other users. These serve as flags to allow other users to know what to expect when interacting with a user. As you collect more experiences badges, this becomes your reputation. Hopefully, they signify something good about your reputation (verified, authentic, etc), but they can also negatively affect your reputation (scammer, etc).&#x20;

Every user can create their own experiences collection. Then, they send the corresponding badge from their collection to whoever they want. Thus, a verified badge from a trusted entity would be much more significant than a scam badge from Bob.

Currently, we expect the collection to have the following badges and IDs respectively. In the future, we plan to add more.
