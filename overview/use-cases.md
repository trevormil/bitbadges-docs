### Asset Tokenization

#### Compliant Tokenized Assets

Tokenize any asset with custom compliance checks enforced on every transfer at the protocol level. Works across liquidity pools, orderbooks, and any application. This ensures that all transfers meet your specific compliance requirements automatically, without relying on individual applications to enforce rules.

#### Real-World Assets

Tokenize physical assets like jewelry, art, collectibles, or any product that can be purchased with any IBC currency. Leverage our multi-currency support and permissioned IBC transfers to create a seamless experience for buyers and sellers across different blockchain networks.

#### Real Estate with License Verification

Tokenize real estate with property licenses verified on every transfer. Ensures only valid, licensed properties can be transferred, providing an additional layer of security and compliance for real estate transactions on-chain.

#### Compliant ICS20 Token Derivatives

Create compliant derivatives of existing ICS20 tokens (like USDC) that are backed 1:1 by the original asset but include custom compliance and transferability rules. For example, wrap USDC into a clUSDC derivative with custom rate limits, compliance checks, withdrawal restrictions, and other programmable constraints. This enables chains to use permissioned, compliant versions of standard tokens while maintaining full backing by the original asset. Perfect for creating siloed compliance environments where you need custom rules for specific use cases without modifying the underlying token standard.

### NFTs and Collectibles

#### Collectibles & Profile Pictures

Standard NFT collection mechanics with full transferability controls. Create collectibles and profile pictures with custom rarity and transfer rules. Perfect for digital art, gaming assets, and social media profile customization.

#### Gated NFTs & Quests

Mint NFTs and quests gated by criteria from 7000+ no-code apps. Email verification, Discord server membership, or any custom requirement can unlock access. This enables sophisticated access control without writing custom code.

#### Quest Rewards as NFTs

Reward quest completion with NFTs that have payouts attached. Use criteria-based approvals to gate quest rewards through 7000+ no-code apps. Ideal for gaming platforms, loyalty programs, and engagement campaigns.

### Soulbound Tokens

#### Soulbound Tokens

Non-transferable tokens for achievements, credentials, attestations, and proof of anything. Make the collection non-transferable to lock tokens to addresses. Perfect for representing permanent achievements, educational credentials, or identity verification that should never be transferred.

#### Compliance-as-a-Service

Integrate BitBadges as a modular compliance checking system alongside existing token standards like ERC-3643 or x/bank. While your token uses standard protocols, BitBadges provides sophisticated compliance verification by checking ownership of compliance tokens—including licenses, subscriptions, NFTs, badges, KYC credentials, address lists, and more. True on-chain compliance requires handling 20+ standardized components automatically.

### Subscriptions and Recurring Payments

#### Auto-Renewing Subscriptions

Create subscription tokens purchasable with any IBC currency that auto-renew via bots. Optional provider revocation capabilities for flexible cancellation policies. Enables seamless subscription management with automatic renewals and flexible cancellation options.

#### Payroll Automation

Develop complex payroll automation systems seamlessly with recurring payments. No-code setup with automated verification. Check if recipients are still employed with NFTs and custom criteria enforcement. Streamline payroll processes with blockchain-based verification and automation.

### Securities and Financial Instruments

#### Stocks with Accredited Investor KYC

Tokenize stocks with accredited investor KYC requirements enforced through custom transferability approvals. Only verified investors can receive securities, ensuring compliance with securities regulations automatically at the protocol level.

#### Freezable & Revocable Currencies

Tokenize currencies with issuer-controlled freezability and revocability features. Managers can freeze or revoke transfers when needed for compliance. Essential for regulated currencies, stablecoins, and financial instruments that require administrative oversight.

#### Bonds & CDs with Clawbacks

Tokenize bonds and certificates of deposit with clawback capabilities. Enables sophisticated financial instruments with built-in administrative controls for compliance and risk management.

### Time-Based Systems

#### Time-Vested Unlocks

Implement time-vested unlock mechanisms that gradually allocate tokens with time-dependent balances, approvals, and more. Perfect for employee stock options, token vesting schedules, and gradual reward distribution.

#### Time-Vested Escrows

Create escrow systems with time-based release conditions. Assets are held in custody until specific time requirements are met. Ideal for milestone-based payments, conditional releases, and time-gated transactions.

#### Expiring Access Tokens

Create authentication tokens, such as tickets, that expire using time-dependent balances. Perfect for temporary access credentials and session management. Enables time-limited access control for events, services, or digital resources.

#### Auto-Expiring Occupation Tokens

Create time-dependent occupation tokens for renting, bookings, or temporary ownership that automatically expire at specified times. Perfect for rental agreements, event tickets, and time-bound access. Ensures automatic expiration without manual intervention.

#### Rental Agreements

Establish time-dependent leases and rental agreements with custom terms of service using flexible approvals. All contracts, payments, and access rights are enforced on-chain with automatic expiration. Provides transparent, automated rental management on the blockchain.

### Legal and Compliance

#### Dispute Resolution & Clearing

Build dispute resolution or clearing protocols. Define the rules to hold, freeze, or reverse transactions. Enables sophisticated dispute management systems with programmable resolution logic.

#### Advanced Admin Controls

Enable advanced revocability and freezability features for administrators. Perfect for regulatory compliance or emergency asset protection. Provides powerful administrative tools for managing tokenized assets in regulated environments.

#### Intellectual Property Rights

Tokenize patents and IP rights with controlled licensing. Enforce IP ownership and licensing terms on every transfer. Ensures that intellectual property rights are properly managed and enforced throughout the token lifecycle.

### Business Operations

#### Refund & Return Policies

Implement receipt systems with automated return policies through custom transferability approvals. Enable seamless refunds with payouts on-chain. Streamlines e-commerce operations with automated refund processing.
