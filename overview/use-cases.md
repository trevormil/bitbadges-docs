### Badge Use Cases <a href="#potential-use-cases-1" id="potential-use-cases-1"></a>

* **Authentication / Tiered Services -** Most companies' infrastructure simply consists of authentication + tiered services. Companies can outsource their authentication to Web3 / [Blockin](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/7VSYQvtb1QtdWFsEGoUn/s/AwjdYgEsUkK9cCca5DiU/) and verify ownership through tiered services badges (family plan badge vs normal user badge). Much cheaper, more secure, and less work!
* **Attendance Badges -** Mint an attendance badge as a souvenir!
* **Decentralized Verification** - Multiple verification services can give out verification badges, and you can choose which person/entity to get your verification ticks from. Or, verification can be more fine-grained and each entity / company can assign badges to their own registered employees / community.
* **Cross-Chain Protocols -** Implement a cross-chain follow, messaging, social media, etc protocols where every post, message, item is a badge being transferred / minted.
* **Memberships/Subscriptions/Access Tokens** - Badges can define expiration dates, so you can offer a limited time membership for anything from a gym membership to a Spotify subscription. Proof of ownership is easily done through our public API.
* **Premium Content** - Premium content can be offered only to badge holders.
* **Recognition of Achievement or Completion** - Job certifications, awards, athletic accomplishments, etc.
* **E-Learning** - Gamify the learning experience through learning badges
* **University Diplomas** - Universities can offer verifiable diplomas to students as a badge.
* **Publications** - Verify you are the author of a publication
* **Real Estate** - Custom encrypted title ownership, HOAs, and even MLS documents registered through the blockchain
* And more!
