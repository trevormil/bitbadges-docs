                A view is a way of fetching additional details about an account, and
                these will be queryable in the response via the `views` property.


                Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
                supplied to get the next page.


                We support the following views:

                - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the account.

                - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
                account.

                - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the account.

                - `badgesCollected` - Fetches the badges collected by the account
                sequentially in random order.

                        Metadata IDs are helpful when determining UNQIUE URIs to be fetched.


                        If badges 1-10000 all share the same URI, they will have the same
                        single metadata ID.

                        If badge 1 has a different URI than badges 2-10000, badge 1 will
                        have a different metadata ID than the rest/


                        We scan in increasing order of badge IDs, so metadata ID 1 will be
                        for badge 1-X, metadata ID 2 will be for badge X+1-Y, etc.


                        ID 0 = Collection metadata fetch

                        ID 1 = First badge metadata fetch

                        ID 2 = Second badge metadata fetch (if present)

                A view is a way of fetching additional details about a collection, and
                these will be queryable in the response via the `views` property.

                Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
                supplied to get the next page.

                If the bookmark is not supplied, the first page will be returned.


                We support the following views:

                - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the collection.

                - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
                collection.

                - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the collection.

                - `owners` - Fetches the owners of the collection sequentially in random
                order.

                - `merkleChallenges` - Fetches the merkle challenges for the collection
                in random order.

                - `approvalTrackers` - Fetches the approvals trackers for the collection
                in random order.

                A view is a way of fetching additional details about a collection, and
                these will be queryable in the response via the `views` property.

                Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
                supplied to get the next page.

                If the bookmark is not supplied, the first page will be returned.


                We support the following views:

                - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the collection.

                - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
                collection.

                - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the collection.

                - `owners` - Fetches the owners of the collection sequentially in random
                order.

                - `merkleChallenges` - Fetches the merkle challenges for the collection
                in random order.

                - `approvalTrackers` - Fetches the approvals trackers for the collection
                in random order.

                    Codes

                    1. Generate N codes privately

                    2. Hash each code

                    3. Store the hashed codes publicly on IPFS via this struct

                    4. When a user enters a code, we hash it and check if it matches any
                    of the hashed codes. This way, the codes are never stored publicly on
                    IPFS and only known by the generator of the codes.

                    Whitelist

                    For storing a public whitelist of addresses (with
                    useCreatorAddressAsLeaf = true), hashing complicates everything
                    because the whitelist can be stored publicly.

                    1. Generate N whitelist addresses

                    2. Store the addresses publicly on IPFS via this struct

                    3. When a user enters an address, we check if it matches any of the
                    addresses.

                JSPrimitiveNumberType is a type that can be used to represent a number
                in JavaScript in multiple ways.

                Because the blockchain supports numbers > 2^53, we need to use BigInts
                or strings to represent them.


                JSPrimitiveNumberType is a union of all the types that can be used to
                represent a number in JavaScript.

                This is the same as NumberType, but without BigInts because they are not
                a primitive.
