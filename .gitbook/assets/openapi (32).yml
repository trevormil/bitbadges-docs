        This defines the options for fetching additional account details.


        A view is a way of fetching additional details about an account, and
        these will be queryable in the response via the `views` property.


        Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
        supplied to get the next page.


        We support the following views:

        - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the account.

        - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
        account.

        - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the account.

        - `badgesCollected` - Fetches the badges collected by the account
        sequentially in random order.

            will be fetched.

            Metadata IDs are helpful when determining UNQIUE URIs to be fetched.


            If badges 1-10000 all share the same URI, they will have the same
            single metadata ID.

            If badge 1 has a different URI than badges 2-10000, badge 1 will
            have a different metadata ID than the rest/


            We scan in increasing order of badge IDs, so metadata ID 1 will be
            for badge 1-X, metadata ID 2 will be for badge X+1-Y, etc.


            ID 0 = Collection metadata fetch

            ID 1 = First badge metadata fetch

            ID 2 = Second badge metadata fetch (if present)

            And so on

        A view is a way of fetching additional details about a collection, and

        Each view has a bookmark that is used for pagination and must be
        supplied to get the next page.

        If the bookmark is not supplied, the first page will be returned.


        We support the following views:

        - `transferActivity` - Fetches the latest activity for the collection.

        - `latestAnnouncements` - Fetches the latest announcements for the
        collection.

        - `reviews` - Fetches the latest reviews for the collection.

        - `owners` - Fetches the owners of the collection sequentially in random
        order.

        - `merkleChallenges` - Fetches the merkle challenges for the collection
        in random order.

        in random order.

          Codes

          1. Generate N codes privately

          2. Hash each code

          3. Store the hashed codes publicly on IPFS via this struct

          4. When a user enters a code, we hash it and check if it matches any
          of the hashed codes. This way, the codes are never stored publicly on
          IPFS and only known by the generator of the codes.

          Whitelist

          For storing a public whitelist of addresses (with
          useCreatorAddressAsLeaf = true), hashing complicates everything
          because the whitelist can be stored publicly.

          1. Generate N whitelist addresses

          2. Store the addresses publicly on IPFS via this struct

          3. When a user enters an address, we check if it matches any of the
          addresses.

        JSPrimitiveNumberType is a type that can be used to represent a number
        in JavaScript in multiple ways.

        Because the blockchain supports numbers > 2^53, we need to use BigInts
        or strings to represent them.


        JSPrimitiveNumberType is a union of all the types that can be used to
        represent a number in JavaScript.

        This is the same as NumberType, but without BigInts because they are not
        a primitive.
