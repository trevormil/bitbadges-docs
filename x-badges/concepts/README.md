# 🧠 Concepts

This directory contains detailed explanations of the core concepts and data structures that form the foundation of the BitBadges module.

* [**UintRange**](uintrange.md) - Representing ranges of unsigned integers
* [**Timeline System**](timeline-system.md) - How properties change over time with immutable historical records
* [**Collections**](badge-collections.md) - The primary entity that defines groups of related tokens
* [**Balance System**](balance-system.md) - How token ownership is tracked with precise control over quantities and time
* [**Collection Setup Fields**](../../token-standard/learn/collection-setup-fields.md) - Valid token IDs, standards, metadata, custom data, default balances, archived status, and invariants
* [**Total Supply**](total-supply.md) - Maximum number of tokens that can exist for each token ID
* [**Mint Escrow Address**](mint-escrow-address.md) - Reserved address for holding native funds on behalf of the Mint address
* [**Manager**](manager.md) - Central authority for collection administration with timeline-based control
* [**Transferability & Approvals**](transferability-approvals.md) - Overview of the three-tier approval system for token transfers
* [**Approval Criteria**](approval-criteria/) - Detailed approval criteria and conditions for token transfers
* [**Address Lists**](address-lists.md) - Reusable collections of addresses for approval configurations
* [**Permissions**](permissions/) - Granular control over collection management operations
* [**Time Fields**](time-fields.md) - Understanding the different time-related fields used throughout BitBadges
* [**Cosmos Wrapper Paths**](cosmos-wrapper-paths.md) - Wrapping between tokens and native Cosmos SDK coins for IBC compatibility
* [**IBC Backed Paths**](ibc-backed-paths.md) - IBC-backed Cosmos SDK coin paths for collection minting
