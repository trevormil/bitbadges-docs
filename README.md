# 👋 BitBadges Overview

## 🚀 The Next-Generation Token Standard

BitBadges offers tokenization-as-a-service and gating-as-a-service. We are building the best tokenization standard out there because current standards are simply not good enough. Our revolutionary token standard goes far beyond ERC-20, ERC-721, and other existing standards with features like time-dependent ownership, fine-grained transferability controls, multi-chain compatibility, connecting to 7000+ apps, connecting to EVM, IBC, CosmWASM, and more.

### ❓ Why BitBadges?

Traditional token standards are limited, inflexible, and locked to single blockchain ecosystems. BitBadges fixes this with a 100x improvement that supports:

* **Multi-Chain Compatibility** - Users from ANY blockchain can own and transfer the SAME tokens. One interface, one token experience for all blockchain ecosystems.
* **Time-Dependent Ownership** - Create subscriptions, time-locked tokens, and expiring credentials
* **Advanced Transferability** - Fine-grained controls over who can transfer what, when, and how on any level
* **No Code by Default, No Smart Contracts Required** - Everything works out-of-the-box with no code
* **Connect to 7000+ Apps** - Connect to 7000+ apps and integrations with seamless on/off-chain criteria checks
* **Connect to Cosmos via IBC** - Connect to Cosmos and beyond via IBC and use the BitBadges token standard on any Cosmos chain
* **Extend with CosmWASM or EVM Contracts** - Extend the BitBadges token standard with CosmWASM or EVM contracts
* **Customizable Permissions** - Flexible manager controls for collections

## 🛠️ Supporting Services

We also offer complementary services:

* **Sign In with BitBadges** - Universal, outsource multi-chain authentication
* **Claims** - Check criteria and deliver rewards in no-code off-chain from 7000+ apps and integrations
* **Address Lists** - Manage users across multiple blockchains

## 🔍 How BitBadges Works

BitBadges can be simply thought of in two parts.

**Criteria Checking:** Let us do the heavy lifting of checking the criteria through multi-chain authentication, criteria checks from 7000+ apps, multi-chain badges / NFTs, points, address lists, and much more!

**Utility:** Seamlessly offer gated services like websites, URLs, tiered perks, subscriptions, anything to users who meet the criteria!

## 💡 Use Cases

Create anything from subscriptions and memberships to tradable NFTs, credentials, and access tokens - all with the most advanced token standard ever built.

## 🤔 Motive for building BitBadges?

The answer is simple. We believe in the potential of blockchains and a multi-chain world, but this potential cannot be realized with the current infrastructure and technology in place today.

## 🤖 Tokens vs Badges?

BitBadges uses the terms tokens and badges interchangeably. You will often see us refer to badges throughout this documentation. This means tokens.
