# ðŸ‘‹ BitBadges Overview

## Overview&#x20;

Digital tokens (badges) are simply something that you can own digitally and prove ownership of it. You probably already use and own many digital tokens: verification checkmarks, a movie streaming subscription, concert tickets, etc. These tokens can be used for infinitely many [use cases](./#use-cases), each potentially offering you different utility and value. Some may have real-world use cases (e.g. entry to a concert), and some may be purely digital (e.g. verification checkmark).&#x20;

When combined with blockchain technology, they become even more secure and more powerful, due to the unique properties of the blockchain ([read more here](https://101blockchains.com/advantages-of-nfts/)).&#x20;

**BitBadges can be described as tokenization-as-a-service. We offer an open-source, community-driven suite of tools that enable you to create, customize, verify, and integrate with digital blockchain tokens for any use case that you desire.**&#x20;

We offer all services you may need from the required storage (blockchain, data indexing, off-chain data storage) to tools for distributing to users via your preferred method to offline-first verification tools (in-person verification, website gated sign-ins) and more!

Additionally, the BitBadges app ([https://bitbadges.io](https://bitbadges.io)) allows you to show off your badges and build your digital identity as you collect more over time! On the flip side, you can browse others' badges to get a sense of their digital identity (e.g. are they a scammer or trustworthy?). This app has a social media feel but is also the all-in-one site to see any information about a user.

## Core Ideas

What are the core ideas and principles behind BitBadges?

* **Rapidly-Evolving**:  Create a single, dynamic token standard that rapidly evolves and improves over time.
  * Token standards should be flexible and continuously adding new functionality, as opposed to existing ones which are rigid, not adaptable, and hard to adopt new ones.
* **Cross-Chain**: Tokens should support users from ANY blockchain
  * Currently, token standards are limited to one blockchain ecosystem (e.g. only Ethereum users or only Bitcoin users). This is a HUGE problem because most companies do not belong to a specific blockchain ecosystem, so it restricts their potential userbase!
  * Ex: Imagine if a sporting event was limited to only Android users because the ticketing technology only worked on Android!
* **Option for Decentralization:** Users should always have an option to interact with BitBadges in a trustless, decentralized manner. However, but we recognize that >90% of users don't care about decentralization.&#x20;
  * We offer functionality that sacrifices decentralization for user experience and scalability, but the option for full decentralization and trustless interaction will always be there.
* **User-Friendly**: Prioritize user experience over everything else.&#x20;
  * Users should not even need to know what a blockchain is or that they are using a blockchain. It should be as simple as browsing a typical website.
* **Ecosystem:** Make developing within the BitBadges ecosystem as easy as possible.
  * Long term, the goal is to have an ecosystem of thousands of community-built projects and tools for interacting with BitBadges.
* **Generic:** Design everything in a generic way that supports universality
* **Open-Source:** All code that makes BitBadges work will be open-sourced for public review

## Improvements Over Existing Products

What makes our product better than existing products?

Just to name a few:

* **Cross-Chain:** Supports users from multiple blockchain ecosystems instead of just one
* **Reused and Battle-Tested Code:** Instead of having to write new custom code for every collection of tokens (as existing standards do), our code is reused by all collections which makes it much more scalable and battle-tested (see [here](overview/faq.md#what-makes-bitbadges-better-than-competitors)).
* [**Balance Types**](overview/how-it-works/balances-types.md)**:** We have created two new ways to store and track balances, in addition to the standard on-chain storage of balances. These can offer over 1000x better scalability and much better user experience.
  * 1\) Off-chain balances allow you to host your balances via a typical server, reducing the resources used by the blockchain by >99%.&#x20;
  * 2\) Inherited balances allow the owners of one badge to automatically be bounded to another.
* [**ID Ranges**](overview/how-it-works/balances-transfers.md)**:** All balances accounting is done with ID ranges. Instead of needing 1000 transactions to send 1000 unique non-fungible badges (e.g. x1 of Badge ID 1, x1 of ID 2, ...), you can batch all into one transaction efficiently (e.g. send x1 of Badge IDs 1-1000).
* [**Time-Based Accounting**](overview/how-it-works/balances-transfers.md)**:** All balances are time-based. This enables you to transfer a badge for only a specific period of time (e.g. subscription token for a month), clearly define token unlock schedules, or approve a transfer only for a specific period of time.&#x20;
* [**Transferability Customization**](overview/how-it-works/transferability.md)**:** Existing standards simply abstract transferability to a simple "transferable" or "non-transferable". However, we recognize that transferability is a complex protocol of who can transfer to who? at what times? what badges? how many? revokable? freezable? forceful transfers? or requires approval? And more. Our interface handles all of this.
  * Additionally, we have a feature to only allow transfers if you pass challenges, such as if you provide a valid password or own (or don't own) badges of another collection! Ex: Only those who own the verified badge can transfer. Or, only those who do not own a scammer badge can transfer and interact with your collection.&#x20;
* [**Collection and User-Level Approvals**](overview/how-it-works/transferability.md)**:** We define three levels of transferability and approvals (collection-wide, incoming, and outgoing), allowing us to clearly define the transferability and enable many neat features like revokable badges, freezing badges, opt-in only collections, and more!
* [**Customizable Permissions**](overview/how-it-works/permissions.md)**:**  Enable customizable permissions for your collection, such as archiving the collection, deleting it, updating its metadata, updating transferability, etc.
* **Time-Based Details:** Important collection details such as metadata are time-based, allowing you to automatically commit to updating it at a future time without needing to transact at that time.
* **Decentralization:** We keep decentralization as a core principle, as opposed to some of our competitors who rely on more centralized architectures.

And much more coming soon!

## Products

BitBadges offers an L1 delegated proof-of-stake blockchain built with Cosmos SDK that enables the natively cross-chain issuance of digital tokens (e.g. an Ethereum user can seamlessly issue a badge to a Cosmos user). The blockchain is able to attain instant transaction finality using Tendermint and natively supports users from multiple Layer 1 blockchains (Ethereum, Cosmos) via IBC and account mappings.

BitBadges provides their own website to view and interact with the BitBadges blockchain at [https://bitbadges.io](https://bitbadges.io). This site aims to be the all-in-one site for any crypto user from any blockchain (see a user's badges, digital collectibles, transaction history, reviews, etc all on one site).

The BitBadges Indexer is a tool used to fetch the latest blockchain information and store any additional data that is needed (e.g. user activity, metadata, etc).

The BitBadges team runs their own indexer and provides a user-friendly developer API to allow developers to build on top of it with, but you may also run and customize your own indexer.

The BitBadges SDK is a TypeScript library that provides all the tools you need to develop on top of BitBadges.

{% endcontent-ref %}

Blockin is a universal, multi-chain sign-in interface for Web 3.0. While Blockin is not an official BitBadges product, Blockin was co-created and is maintained by one of the BitBadges founders, trevormil.eth.&#x20;

Blockin plans to integrate many features using BitBadges, such as badge-gating sign-ins for websites.
