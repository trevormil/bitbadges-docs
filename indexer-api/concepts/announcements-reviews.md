# Announcements / Reviews

We additionally support two types of activity: announcements and reviews.

**Announcements**

As the manager of the collection, you can send an announcement to all badge owners. The announcement will be shown in their activity. All announcements are handled and stored off-chain via the indexer database (i.e. nothing is done on the blockchain).

**Reviews**

You can also optionally leave reviews on collections and users to provide feedback. Other users will be able to see those reviews.
