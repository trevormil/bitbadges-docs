# IPFS

The IPFS endpoints are provided to allow you to store files on IPFS directly through the API. It is currently limited to 100MB total cumulative storage per unique address.

Note this is just provided for ease of use. If you need more, you can always send to IPFS on your own and provide the URI yourself.
