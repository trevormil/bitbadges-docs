# Broadcast / Simulate Txs

Broadcasting / simulating transactions are simply helper methods to interact with a BitBadges blockchain node. You can choose to interact directly with a custom node yourself and not go through the API.

For the official BitBadges API, these endpoints will broadcast / simulate transactions using the official BitBadges blockchain nodes.&#x20;

You can also visit [https://bitbadges.io/dev/broadcast](https://bitbadges.io/dev/broadcast) to manually copy and paste a transaction to broadcast.
