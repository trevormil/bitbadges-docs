# Codes / Passwords

Password / code based claims are simply [Merkle Challenges](../../for-developers/concepts/approval-options.md) where the leaves of the Merkle tree are all unique codes generated by the claim creator (and thus only known to the claim creator and not public). The claim creator then distributes the codes to the users they want to receive the badges / be approved. For an example, see [Claims](broken-reference).

Distribution of the codes can be done via many methods, including via a password. Passwords make it so that only one password needs to be distributed to all users for ease of use. For password-based claims, to avoid replay attacks (since the blockchain is public), we still create N unique codes via a MerkleChallenge but distribute them in a centralized manner (one per address) to whoever enters the correct password.

To provide a better user experience on the BitBadges website, the official BitBadges indexer stores these codes / passwords in a centralized manner to eliminate storage requirements for the user. The indexer also provides endpoints to distribute the codes, including being the distributor for handling passwords. **Note these routes will only work if the claim was created through the indexer you are fetching from. Unconnected indexers do not have access to the passwords / codes stored in the other ones.**

However, note that this is provided for ease of use, but also introduces another centralized trust factor. You always have the option to self-store and distribute your own codes and passwords / implement your own Merkle Challenges.
