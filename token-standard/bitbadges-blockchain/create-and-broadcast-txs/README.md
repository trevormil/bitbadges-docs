# Create, Generate, and Sign Txs

To learn more about broadcasting transactions with Cosmos SDK, you can visit [https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/txs.html](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/txs.html).

We recommend generating, signing, and broadcasting your transactions with the [BitBadges SDK](../../../for-developers/bitbadges-sdk/). The SDK provides easy-to-use TypeScript functions to construct transactions of all types and broadcast them to a blockchain node.&#x20;

You can also run the BitBadges blockchain software and interact with its CLI, but this is more complicated and only supports Cosmos signatures.
