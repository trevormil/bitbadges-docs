Existing tokenization standards (ERC/CW/ICS-20/721) are good for many use cases, but the system is **flawed from the ground up**.

## Problems

**Simple**: They lack the flexibility and feature set needed for 90% of real-world applications. Simple mint, transfer, and burn functionality with no custom compliance or transferability rules is nowhere near enough. The industry has been stuck with these simple standards and no innovation for 10+ years due to technical debt.

**Vulnerable**: They are vulnerable by default due to the smart contract approach. Each token contract introduces a new attack vector and chance of vulnerability. The whole smart contract approach is flawed and not sustainable.

**Complex**: A simple contract requires extensive technical knowledge to implement.

**Expensive**: Contracts are expensive to deploy and maintain.

**Low Interoperability**: Ecosystem-agnostic companies do not want to split their userbase or handle tokens on multiple chains. They want an all-in-one solution that is compatible with any user from any ecosystem out of the box.

**Many Competing Standards**: There are many competing standards and products for tokenization. Each tokenization product adds its own little twists that are not compatible with other products. This creates fragmentation and confusion.

**The whole tokenization approach is broken from the foundation and NEEDS a complete overhaul.**
