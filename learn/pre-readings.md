### Explore the BitBadges Platform

Familiarize yourself with the platform by exploring [bitbadges.io](https://bitbadges.io). We always recommend that the best way to learn is just go and try stuff out first:

-   Review the landing and explore pages
-   Complete the collection creation flow
-   Examine transaction JSONs by clicking "Show Tx" at the end of different creation flows

Everything is no-code and plug-and-play by default. You may have all you need directly in-site!
