# Overview

The core of BitBadges is the BitBadges L1 blockchain built with [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/main) and [Ignite CLI](https://docs.ignite.com/). The source code can be found at [https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadgeschain](https://github.com/bitbadges/bitbadgeschain). The blockchain supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) and CosmWASM ([a forked version from Notional Labs](https://github.com/notional-labs/wasmd)).

**Goal**

Build a dynamic, multi-chain token interface on the blockchain that can support all functionalities of tokens and do it in the most efficient way possible. We will continuously adapt this interface to support any use case.

The end goal is that no smart contract is ever needed to be created. Although for now, tokens can be wrapped with smart contracts (CosmWASM) for unsupported functionality.

**Current Supported Chains**

Ethereum, Cosmos
